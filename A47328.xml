            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> following Diſcourſe, ſuch as it is, I do with all humility preſent to your Lordſhip. The argument it treats of commends it ſelf, and challengeth regard from all the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The deſign of it is to prove our <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> This is a truth of the greateſt moment, and as ſuch was much inſiſted upon by the firſt preachers of the Chriſtian Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:65506:3"/>and deſervedly placed in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Creed in the head of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles of our Chriſtian faith, and next after the Article in which we own the belief of a God. And whatever defects there may be found in the following Tract yet, as I am certain that I have choſen a moſt excellent Subject, ſo I have purſued it with a ſincere and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt intention.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould find fault with this <hi>well-meant</hi> Diſcourſe, and <hi>condemn</hi> me even for that for which I am not able ſo much as to <hi>accuſe</hi> my ſelf, it ſhall be ſo far from creating me any trouble that it will not <hi>ſurprize</hi> me as any thing that is <hi>new</hi> and <hi>ſtrange</hi> is wont to do. Whatever my <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> or my <hi>faults</hi> may be, I ſhall be ſo far from being <hi>pertinacious</hi> in either of them, that no man ſhall be more welcome to me than
<pb facs="tcp:65506:3"/>he, who ſhall aſſiſt me in diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging me from them. Nor do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live any longer in this world than whiles I am diſpoſed both to <hi>find</hi> the truth and to <hi>follow</hi> it.</p>
            <p>I think my ſelf more eſpecially obliged to give your Lordſhip an account how I ſpend my time. And that conſideration moved me to prefix your Lordſhip's name to this following Diſcourſe. But that was not the onely motive which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to it. All that have the honour to know your Lirdſhip have great cauſe to bleſs God for you. The Clergy of this great City are very ſenſible of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. They look upon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as a great Bleſſing, and a good preſage. The Jews have a ſaying in their books, that <hi>when the Shepherd is angry with the ſheep he placeth over them a blind guide.</hi> Thoſe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:65506:4"/>your Lordſhip's care juſtly look upon you as beſtowed upon them as a token for good; they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves favoured greatly, in your Lordſhip, by the great Biſhop and Shepherd of their Souls. I was willing to take this opportunity of teſtifying my moſt unfeigned thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God for your Lordſhip. That God would long preſerve your Lordſhip, and aſſiſt and proſper your endeavours for the good of his Church; that he would pour upon you the bleſſings of this life and preſerve you to the unſpeakable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the next, is the moſt hearty Prayer of,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is ſaid of our bleſſed Saviour, upon his healing a withered hand (when the <hi>Jews watched him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would heal on the Sabbath-day, that they might accuſe him</hi>) that he <hi>looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts</hi> (Mark 3. v. 5.) He looked on them with <hi>anger,</hi> and with <hi>compaſſion</hi> at the ſame time. Thus have all the ſincere Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> been affected towards that people ever ſince our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's time, and very fit it is that they ſhould imitate their great Lord and Maſter. He that loves his Lord, and his holy Religion cannot but be moved
<pb facs="tcp:65506:5"/>with ſome degree of anger when he conſiders how that people perſecuted <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his followers, and have ever ſhewed an unplacable hatred againſt the incomparable Religion which they planted in the world. They do in their books, which we have in our hands, reproach our Bleſſed Saviour; and with great bitterneſs diſparage and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate thoſe holy writers, which give us an account of our Saviour's birth, of his life and Doctrine; and theſe practices of theirs have been an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of many evils which have befallen them, and have drawn upon them the <hi>anger</hi> of the Chriſtian States or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms where they have lived. Nor is it ſtrange at all that Chriſtians ſhould be moved with ſome degree of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt thoſe men who <hi>Scoff</hi> at that <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom they worſhip.</p>
            <p>But how excuſable ſoever this indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be, yet it ought to be attended with <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>compaſſion.</hi> This we may learn from the example of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was grieved for the hardneſs of their heart and did to the laſt breath pray for theſe men who had no pity or
<pb facs="tcp:65506:5"/>compaſſion upon him. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had been greatly perſecuted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> was ſo far from being unconcerned for them that he moſt ſolemnly profeſſeth that he had <hi>great heavineſs</hi> and <hi>continual ſorrow in his heart</hi> upon their account. And ſo great was his charity that he could <hi>wiſh himſelf accurſed from Chriſt</hi> for their ſakes, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3.)</p>
            <p>And whatever opinion Chriſtians may have entertained, concerning the converſion of the nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it muſt be granted that it is our duty to doe all we can toward the gaining ſo good an end. And whatever is done to this purpoſe, by any Chriſtian States, or particular Perſons, however it may <hi>miſs</hi> of its deſired <hi>effect</hi> will not <hi>fail</hi> of a <hi>reward.</hi> It is very well known where the <hi>Jews</hi> are obliged to hear the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or Lectures of the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> And there are thoſe charitable perſons in the Church who would much rejoice to find them under the ſame obligation in other <hi>States</hi> and Chriſtian <hi>Kingdoms</hi> alſo. A lecture for this very end and purpoſe might have good effects: For
<pb facs="tcp:65506:6"/>though it be not effectual where it is uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it is no hard thing to aſſign ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable reaſons how that comes to paſs. Thus much is certain that if we would gain the <hi>Jews</hi> it will become us to doe all in our power to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: And though ſome men have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligations yet every Chriſtian is obliged, in his dealings with them, to uſe them with great humanity, to trade with them with exact Juſtice and ſimplicity, and to adorn our Religion by an exemplary life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For the following diſcourſe, I am to acquaint the Reader that I do not ſend it abroad as a juſt Tract deſigned onely againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> Had this been my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign I ſhould have taken other Methods. I intended the advantage of the Chriſtian Reader alſo; and hope that the younger among them may receive ſome benefit thereby. It is our common Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which I here defend; and I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to explain ſome difficult places of the holy Writ which have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by ſome men, and ſcoffed at by others. In all that I have done I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb facs="tcp:65506:6"/>purſued after truth; if I have any where miſtaken I ſhall moſt readily and thankfully hearken to him who ſhall ſhew me my Error.</p>
            <p>I do intend a ſecond part, in which I deſign to examine the objections which we find in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth which I have defended in this firſt, and againſt the Religion which <hi>Jeſus</hi> taught. I ſhall in that particularly conſider their pretenſes for their unbelief: And they are ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That their law is of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual obligation; that the promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was conditional, and the time of his coming not fixed; that there are ſome Prophecies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and his times not fulfilled in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I do very well know that there are in the Church of <hi>England</hi> a great number of men who are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſitted for ſuch an undertaking than. I am: I ſhould be ſo far from eſteeming it a diſappointment if any of them would prevent me, in what I deſign farther, that it
<pb facs="tcp:65506:7"/>would be matter of rejoycing to me. And if what I have done already may be but an occaſion to excite ſome other perſon to doe better, I ſhall think my time well ſpent, and be very well content that what I have here offered ſhould be laid aſide or overlooked.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>I Do intend with God's aſſiſtance, in the enſuing Diſcourſe, to prove that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And ſhall by way of introduction to this weighty Argument reflect ſomething upon the words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the <hi>Jews, Act.</hi> 2.36. And for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe words it is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> before he left his Diſciples, promiſed them the preſence and the aid of the Holy Ghoſt: and a little before his Aſcenſion into Heaven, <hi>he commanded them that they ſhould not depart from Jeruſalem but wait for the promiſe of the Father, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye have heard of me,</hi> Act. 2.4.</p>
            <p>Nor did our Saviour fail to make good his promiſe; but when the day of Pentecoſt was fully come, they are filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and ſpake with divers tongues as the Spirit gave
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65506:13"/>them utterance. This happened at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> at a great ſolemnity, and at a time when the devout and religious of ſeveral Nations were together in the City, who heard the Apoſtles ſpeak in the language of their ſeveral Countries, the wonderfull works of God. <hi>And they were all amazed, and were in a doubt, ſaying one to another, what meaneth this?</hi> v. 12. And there were among the reſt very evil men that were ſo malicious as to mock and ſay, <hi>theſe men are full of new wine.</hi> v. 13.</p>
            <p>This calumny St. <hi>Peter</hi> diſproves, and lets them know that they ſpake by the power of the Holy Ghoſt. And then he preaches to them the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and aſcenſion of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was approved of God by miracles and wonders and ſigns: And he gives them to underſtand, that as this <hi>Jeſus</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo he had alſo now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed this Holy Ghoſt upon them, the effect of which gift they ſaw and heard: And thereupon concludes (as well he might) that he is the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was promiſed. <hi>Therefore let all the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus whom ye have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65506:13"/>crucified, both Lord and Chriſt,</hi> Act. 11.36.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed I ſhall take notice of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: God hath <hi>made</hi> that ſame <hi>Jeſus:</hi> That is, ſays <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he hath ordained or appointed <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be Lord and Chriſt. And the Greek word will well bear this ſenſe as well as the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Thus it is ſaid of our Saviour (<hi>Mar.</hi> 3.14.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.e.</hi> he <hi>made</hi> twelve, or, <hi>ordained</hi> twelve, as we tranſlate it well. He choſe twelve ſays the <hi>Syriac</hi> verſion. Again <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.34. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, As the LXXII render it. That is, let <hi>Pharaoh make and appoint Officers;</hi> and not as we have rendred it, <hi>Let</hi> Pharaoh <hi>do this,</hi> and let him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. Again, <hi>It is the Lord that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>(or made) as it is in the margent of</hi> 1 Sam. 12.6.</p>
            <p>And we uſually ſpeak after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: when men are advanced to digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and office they are ſaid to be <hi>made</hi> what they are afterwards called. To make a <hi>Conſul,</hi> a <hi>Captain,</hi> or <hi>General,</hi> ſignifies no more than to appoint them and raiſe them to thoſe dignities and offices.</p>
            <p>So that the meaning of theſe words is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, let all the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65506:14"/>
               <hi>Iſraelites</hi> therefore be aſſured of this great and very evident truth, that that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom the Jews have Crucified, is by God the Father (who hath raiſed him from the dead, and taken him up to his right hand) conſtituted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed head of the Church, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated in the Kingly office of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Chriſt or <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was foretold is that which the Apoſtle would have the Jews be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of: And this was the Doctrine, which the firſt preachers of Chriſtian Religion did mainly inſiſt upon: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely an article of the Chriſtian faith, but ſuch an one as is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſt. <hi>Who is a Liar,</hi> ſays St. John, <hi>but he that denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt?</hi> (1 Joh. 2.22.) We read that <hi>Saul confounded the Jews which were at</hi> Damaſcus <hi>proving that this is very Chriſt,</hi> Act. 9.22. He preacheth the ſame Doctrine at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> Acts 17.3. And at <hi>Corinth,</hi> Acts 18.5. And of <hi>Apollos</hi> we read that he <hi>mightily convinced the Jews,</hi> and that <hi>publickly, ſhewing by the Scriptures that Jeſus was Chriſt,</hi> v. 28.</p>

               <p>For the word <hi>Jeſus,</hi> if we conſider its Hebrew Original, it ſignifies a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; And for that reaſon this name was given to our Lord becauſe he was to <hi>ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> Mat. 1.21. And the Angel tells the Shepherds, <hi>unto you is born this day in the City of</hi> David <hi>a Saviour,</hi> Luk. 2.11. And the Apoſtle ſays no leſs when he ſays, <hi>God hath raiſed up unto</hi> Iſrael <hi>a Saviour Jeſus,</hi> Act. 13.23.

                  <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that the heathen gave their God, was unbecoming a Deity. For <hi>Jupiter</hi> being no more but <hi>Juvans pater,</hi> an helping father, it was a term of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution. For one man may help ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And 'tis no great matter to help; but to ſave and deliver imports much. <hi>Non intelligit beneficia Divina, qui ſe tantummodo à Deo juvari putat;</hi> He hath too mean and low an apprehenſion of the Divine benefits that thinks God does onely help him. This is to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute too much to our ſelves and too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to God. He that helps me adds his ſtrength to mine, but he that ſaves ſhews his own power onely. We were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all help and hope too: Our Lord reſcued us, and ſaved us, we contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing toward our deliverance. He is the Saviour of mankind: Our intire deliverance is to be aſcribed to him: And 'twill well become us to conſider how juſtly this name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> belongs to him, and to meditate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while upon the greatneſs of that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deliverance which our Lord hath wrought for us.</p>
               <p>Now our Lord might well be called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a Saviour.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65506:17"/>1. As he hath publiſhed and made known to us the Goſpel which is the power of God unto Salvation: Our Lord hath brought life and immortality to light, and hath ſhewed us the way to eternal life. There was no expreſs promiſe of eternal life in the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> Temporal bleſſings were promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the obedient, but they had no aſſurances given them of a glorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. The way to this our Lord hath revealed plainly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He procured this for us alſo, he bought it with no leſs price than his pretious bloud. And now we ſtand <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> and then we may juſtly expect to be <hi>ſaved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He confers this Salvation upon us: He is ſet down at God's right hand and hath received all power in Heaven and Earth. God hath exalted him <hi>with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance unto Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of Sins,</hi> Act. 5.31. We receive from him the power of his grace here, and juſtly expect from him the glorifying of our ſouls and bodies hereafter.</p>
               <p>And it will well be worth our while
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65506:17"/>to enter into a meditation of this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deliverance which our Lord hath wrought for us. And to that purpoſe let us compare it with thoſe deliverances which were wrought of old for the people of the Jews. For thoſe deliverances may well be called Salvations, and thoſe men that were the inſtruments of them may be called Saviours; for ſo they are called in the Holy Scripture. [2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.27. with the LXXII. <hi>Judg.</hi> 3.9.15.]</p>
               <p>Among thoſe Saviours there was one who was not onely an eminent type of our bleſſed Saviour, but who had the ſame name that was given our Saviour at his Circumciſion; And that was <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun:</hi> For <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> are the ſame name, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> is called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> Heb. 4.8. and <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.17. 'Tis true indeed his name was <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> and ſo he is called; but upon his being choſen to ſpy out or ſearch the Land of <hi>Canaan, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> changed his name from <hi>Hoſhea</hi> to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua;</hi> Num. 23.16. <hi>i. e.</hi> he made an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable alteration of his name (as <hi>Philo</hi> obſerves) when he added to the name he had the firſt letter of the <hi>Tetragrammation:</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65506:18"/>to his name, by putting to it the firſt letter of the name of God, when he ſent him to ſearch the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo that for the future he is a Saviour, and by God's appointment was ſet apart to introduce the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into the Land of Promiſe: <hi>Moſes</hi> the Lawgiver did not bring the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Land; This was left for <hi>Joſhua</hi> to doe.

And though <hi>Moſes,</hi> who brought the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who introduced them into the good Land, and others who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fought their battels, were great deliverers of their people, yet all theſe deliverances put together come greatly ſhort of that which our Lord hath wrought.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65506:21"/>whereas our Lord's was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; So</p>

This is the deliverance that our Lord hath wrought. He ſets us free from our ſins, and hath redeemed us from the wrath to come. This <hi>Jeſus</hi> does for all them that will obey him. He deſtroyed the Devil's Kingdom, ſtopt his mouth in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, overturned his Temples, diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of his Idols; deſtroyed his Worſhip, and baffled him in all his Deſigns. He caſt him out not of the <hi>bodies</hi> onely, but of the <hi>ſouls</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> of men, and wreſted from him that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65506:21"/>Kingdom which he had ſo long and ſo unjuſtly got the poſſeſſion of.</p>
               <p>The World was over-run with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superſtition, with violence and oppreſſion, with ignorance and prophaneneſs; Men were proud and covetous, unchaſt and intemperate, full of envy and malice: But Our Lord came, and by his life and doctrine, by his death and divine grace he ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that darkneſs that overſpread the World; he knocked off thoſe Chains in which men were ſhackled, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored Mankind to the Worſhip of the true God, and to his image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let's hear the excellent words by which the Apoſtle expreſſeth all this. <hi>For we our ſelves</hi> (ſays he) <hi>alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hatefull and hating one another. But after that the kindneſs, and love of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our toward mankind appeared. Not by works of righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt: Which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour,</hi> Tit. 3.3—Such
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65506:22"/>was the deliverance which our <hi>Jeſus</hi> wrought; <hi>For the grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to all men; teaching us, that denying ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteouſly, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world: Looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he brought them from the bondage of thoſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> but he did not ſave them from their <hi>infidelity. For we ſee they could not enter into the promiſed land, becauſe of their unbelief,</hi> Heb. 3.19. <hi>Joſhua</hi> brought them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but left them on this ſide <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Others delivered them from the men of <hi>Midian</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> but none of them delivered them from the <hi>evil men themſelves.</hi> They were ſaved from their <hi>enemies</hi> frequently, but not from their <hi>ſins.</hi> They fell into their <hi>folly</hi> and their <hi>miſery</hi> again.</p>
               <p>But our bleſſed Redeemer ſaves us from our ſin. <hi>He gives repentance and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65506:22"/>forgivenſs of ſins,</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>And turns us from our iniquities,</hi> Acts 3.26. This exalts him above <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua;</hi> this ſpeaks him the great Redeemer and Shepherd of our Souls. The <hi>Jews</hi> expected a <hi>Temporal Meſſiah,</hi> one that would reſtore them their Kingdom, and advance them to worldly ſplendour and greatneſs: But our Lord came to erect a ſpiritual Kingdom in the hearts and minds of men: He came to vanquiſh our luſts, and deſtroy the power of ſin in the hearts of men. This was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign worthy of God, and becoming our Lord Jeſus; And that which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Kings and Princes were never able to doe. Our Lord hath wrought the greateſt deliverance.</p>
               <p>Others have <hi>conquered</hi> their <hi>Enemies;</hi> Our Lord hath done more, He hath <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled</hi> them and made them <hi>friends.</hi> Others have killed the <hi>bodies</hi> of men; our Lord hath done more, he has <hi>ſaved</hi> their <hi>ſouls.</hi> Others have gotten wealth and worldly greatneſs; our Lord does more, when he enables his followers to deſpiſe theſe things. Others have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their followers from dying; our Lord delivers us from the fear of death. He <hi>kills</hi> our <hi>pride, deſtroys</hi> our <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65506:23"/>purges</hi> away our <hi>luſt, plants</hi> in us the <hi>love of God,</hi> and the <hi>contempt</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65506:24"/>and dwelt among them, to them he gave his reſponſes from heaven; There were his Prophets, and they had his Law amongſt them. <hi>He had not dealt ſo with any nation, and for his judgments they had not known them,</hi> Pſal. 147.20. In <hi>Judah</hi> was God known; His Name was great in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> in <hi>Salem</hi> was his Tabernacle, and his dwelling place in <hi>Zion.

Among them he wrought his Wonders, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ſo far from being better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe Wonders, that they were to their loſs.

               </p>
               <p>But our Lord is the Saviour of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> of the <hi>Gentile</hi> as well as <hi>Jew.</hi> He is that light which lighteth every man that comes into the world: That Sun of righteouſneſs, whoſe light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is not confined to any one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or kindred, but diſplays it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the nations of the Earth. The partition wall is taken down, and the difference between man and man is taken away: And whoever comes to our <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhall in no-wiſe be caſt out.

Upon the birth of Jeſus the Angel tells the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds: <hi>Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which ſhall be to all people,</hi> Luke 2.10.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65506:25"/>towards men,</hi> v. 14. Our Lord came not to ſave the <hi>Jews</hi> onely, but all that believe. And 'tis worth our obſerving after what manner the love of God in ſending his Son is expreſſed; Not as confined to the <hi>Jews</hi> any longer, but as reaching to the race of Mankind. <hi>God ſo loved the world</hi> (not the Jewiſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple onely) <hi>that he gave his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 3.16.

               <p>Now for the better underſtanding of the importance of this word <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Anointed,</hi> we ſhall doe well to reflect upon the uſage that obtained among the Jewiſh People, where we ſhall find fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention of the Ceremony of Anointing: That which was anointed was thereby ſeparated to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſpecial uſe, whether it had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>things</hi> or <hi>perſons.</hi> Thus was the Pillar anointed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.18.22. And the Tabernacle and all its Utenſils. They being by that means ſet apart to the Service of God. But this Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of anointing had relation to perſons
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65506:27"/>alſo. Thus the moſt publick Perſons, and Miniſters among the Jews, were by this Ceremony ſet apart to their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices and Dignities: As for example,</p>
               <p>Kings were anointed, whence it is that a King is expreſſed in the ſacred Dialect by <hi>the Lord's anointed.</hi> Thus were <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> anointed by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> according to the Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.1.15.1.16.3.13. And <hi>Zadok</hi> anoints <hi>Solomon,</hi> that there might be no diſpute who ſhould ſucceed <hi>David,</hi> 1 King 1.39. And theſe Kings when they were thus anointed were then God's Vice-gerents over the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh People who were under a <hi>Theocracy:</hi>

Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb. <hi>Hiſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> And when the Prophets did by anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them make them Kings, they made them <hi>Typical Chriſts,</hi> as one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients does expreſs it. And ſo indeed they were. They did typifie the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> who was to be Lord and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church, as theſe Kings were of the Jews.</p>
               <p>Prieſts were anointed alſo: <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, <hi>that they might miniſter unto God in the Prieſt's office. Exod.</hi> 40.13.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65506:27"/>For Prophets the like cannot be ſaid: We have not that expreſs Law, nor the Practice upon record which we have for the other. 'Tis true indeed that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi> is commanded to anoint <hi>Eliſha to be a Prophet in his room,</hi> 1 King. 19.16. And at the ſame time he is commanded to anoint <hi>Hazael</hi> to be King over <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 'Tis probable that no more is meant by that expreſſion than this, that he ſhould conſtitute <hi>Eliſha</hi> to be Prophet in his room, and becauſe men were ſet apart to great offices by the Ceremony of anointing, therefore that expreſſion is uſed there. And that Perſon who is conſtituted and appointed by God to ſome great office or employment is ſaid to be the Lord's Anointed, though he were not ſet apart with material oil to that office, becauſe theſe publick Perſons were wont by the holy oil to be ſet apart to their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Employments: Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Lord's anointed,</hi> Iſa. 45.1.

               <p>Firſt, this was to be a ſign of the Divine election and choice. He that was thus ſet apart was to be received as choſen of God. <hi>I have exalted one choſen out of the People.

This holy oil was a compoſition of God's preſcribing, wherewith certain things and perſons were to be ſet apart, and ſeparated to holy uſes, and 'tis expreſly ſaid, <hi>whoſoever compoundeth any like it, or whoſoever putteth any of it upon a Stranger, ſhall even be cut off from his People,</hi> Exod. 30.33.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65506:28"/>Secondly, that he that was thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed might thereby be prepared to receive <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thus had the Jews under the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſhadow of good things to come, but theſe excellent things which they had in <hi>type,</hi> we have in <hi>ſubſtance. The law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1.17. Our bleſſed Saviour is both Prophet, Prieſt and King. He is the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet who hath taught us the will of God. Our great High Prieſt who made attonement for us, and is entered into the Holy of Holies. He is our King to rule and govern us, and from him we expect the great and unſpeakable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of eternal life. And as the Prieſts and Kings of old were ſet apart to their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65506:29"/>offices and dignities by a certain Oil preſcribed in the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> ſo was our Bleſſed Saviour by a better anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (of which that Oil was but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow) namely, by the Holy Ghoſt; which did not onely deſign him and ſet him apart to theſe great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant offices, but alſo enable him for the performance of them. Thus the Apoſtle tells us that, <hi>God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghoſt, and with power,</hi> Act. 10.38. Now our Saviour was anointed with the Holy Ghoſt,</p>
               <p>Firſt, at his Conception. Thus the Angel tells the bleſſed Virgin, <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee. Therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the Son of God,</hi> Luk. 1.35.</p>
               <p>Secondly, at his Baptiſm, at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jordan,</hi> Matt. 3.13. Mark 1.9. <hi>Now when all the people were baptized, it came to paſs that Jeſus alſo being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and praying, the heaven was opened: And the Holy Ghoſt deſcended in a bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven which ſaid, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleaſed,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65506:30"/>Luk. 3.21, 22. Then did the Holy Ghoſt deſcend viſibly upon <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and as of old (as I ſaid before) anointing was uſed among the Jews as a ſign of God's election and choice of the perſon anointed, ſo was it now. And for the greater aſſurance of it a voice came from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Thou art my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son,</hi> &amp;c. Thus was <hi>Jeſus</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be choſen of God by the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt. And to this I may add the words of the Prophet to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>Behold my ſervant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth: I have put my ſpirit upon him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. And St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells preſently upon the Baptiſm of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that, <hi>he being full of the Holy Ghoſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Jordan, and was led by the ſpirit into the wilderneſs,</hi> Luk. 4.1. And after he was tempted in the Wilderneſs, he tells us that <hi>Jeſus</hi> returned in the <hi>power of the ſpirit</hi> into <hi>Galilee,</hi> ver. 14. And when he was in the Synagogue at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> he opened the book which was delivered him and found that place where 'twas written, <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor,</hi> &amp;c. And ſaid unto them, <hi>This day is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65506:30"/>this Scripture fulfilled in your ears,</hi> v. 21.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour though he were ſanctified from the Womb and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed by the Holy Ghoſt, yet when he was baptized in <hi>Jordan</hi> and about thirty years of age he was again anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſame divine ſpirit more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and openly than before: He was now entring on his great miniſtry, and about to be tempted by the Devil, and is now filled by the Holy Ghoſt, and thereby enabled and prepared for that work which he was going about. In a word, he who was at his Conception anointed with the Holy Ghoſt, was alſo at his Baptiſm,<note place="margin">Matt. 3.16, 17.</note> when he was entring upon his miniſtry, not onely by a voice from heaven proclaimed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son of God, but declared to be ſo by the deſcending of the ſpirit of God like a Dove,<note place="margin">

Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. <hi>in</hi> 2 Reg. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 8.</note> I do grant, and it cannot be denied, that <hi>David</hi> was but once anointed with the holy Oil, and that where it is ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward that the men of <hi>Judah</hi> anointed him, the meaning is onely this, that they <hi>choſe</hi> him and <hi>openly owned</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged</hi> him for their King, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by comparing 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.4. with chap. 4.3, 17. It is enough to my preſent purpoſe that <hi>David</hi> who was more privately anointed at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> was afterward ſo <hi>publickly owned</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> to be the King that he is ſaid again to have been <hi>anointed:</hi> For in this he was eminently a type of our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was from his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception anointed with the Holy Ghoſt, and, when he was, upon his Baptiſm, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon his adminiſtration, was <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi> declared to be the Son of God by a voice from heaven, and by the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Among the Jewiſh Conſtitutions this was one, That the Kings of the houſe of <hi>David</hi> were to be anointed by a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of water. This was a tradition from their Elders grounded upon what
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65506:31"/>we read of <hi>Solomon</hi> that, when he was to be anointed King, <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> and the reſt, that attended upon him brought him unto <hi>Gihon,</hi> 1 King. 1.38. This <hi>Gihon</hi> was a place of waters, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.30. Let this tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be as old as you will; ſuppoſe it came from <hi>Moſes</hi> and was delivered from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as the Jews ſay their Oral law was: ſo it came to paſs that our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the great King of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> was anointed by the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> when the Holy Ghoſt at his Baptiſm deſcended upon him.</p>
               <p>'Twill be eaſie now to underſtand what <hi>Chriſt</hi> imports: For that word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the offices of our bleſſed Saviour to which he was appointed by God, and enabled to diſcharge by the Holy Ghoſt, which was plentifully poured out upon him. And as of old publick perſons were ſet apart to their reſpective offices and dignities by being firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed with a certain Oil preſcribed for that purpoſe, ſo was our Lord ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and fitted to teach and govern the Church of God; to be the great mediatour between God and man, and the redeemer of mankind, by the Holy Ghoſt which he plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65506:32"/>received, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. And he that confeſſes that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt</hi> does thereby acknowledge him to be his Prophet, Prieſt and King: and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently obliged by virtue of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to obey his laws, and give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to his government, as well as to hope for pardon from his bloud. God hath made it very plain that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was promiſed. <hi>Who is a Liar</hi> (ſays St. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>but he that denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.22. This was that great truth that the Jews oppoſed vehemently. They agreed that if any man confeſſed him to be <hi>Chriſt</hi> he ſhould be put out of the Synagogue.</p>
               <p>What hath been ſaid will be of uſe to the better underſtanding the words of St. <hi>John. Ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye know all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.20. He puts Chriſtians in mind of that affuſion of the Holy Ghoſt (which he calls the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the holy one</hi>) which God hath beſtowed on them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s promiſe. This Holy Ghoſt did lead them into all truth, and the plentiful effuſion of this Spirit did bear a clear teſtimony that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that the doctrine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65506:32"/>which he taught came from God. This Holy Spirit was the defence which thoſe Chriſtians had againſt being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. As it follows. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you concerning them that ſeduce you. But the anointing, which ye have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any man teach you: but, as the ſame anointing teacheth you all things and is truth, and is no lie: and, even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.26, 27.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely add that from <hi>Chriſt</hi> we are all called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that bleſſed name ought to influence our practice. 'Tis a great thing to be a Chriſtian: 'Tis a dignity and honour to the greateſt among us, and the beſt of all our titles. We may well glory in this bleſſed name, and value it above all our other titles and properties. But then we muſt remember what this name requires at our hands: When we name the name of Chriſt we are obliged to depart from all iniquity. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how well this name becomes us. Are we like our bleſſed Saviour, have we that unction from the holy one? Does the ſpirit of <hi>Jeſus</hi> dwell in us? If that Holy Spirit be not in us' we have a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65506:33"/>name to live and are dead; we may fondly conceit what we pleaſe of our ſelves, <hi>but if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9.</p>

                  <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
                  <p>It is agreed between Jews and Chriſtians <hi>[I.]</hi> That there was a <hi>Meſſias</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and <hi>[II.]</hi> That there was ſuch a perſon as our <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and <hi>[III.]</hi> That there was at that time when <hi>Jeſus</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a general expectation of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</hi> That hence it was that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo many Impoſtours about that time. An account of ſome of them from <hi>Joſephus.</hi> Of the promiſes of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the gradual revealing of them. A Paſſage in <hi>Maimon.</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Afternoon-Prayer miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by a late learned writer. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particulars relating to the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> predicted.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus having ſhewed what is meant by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and what by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> I come next to ſhew you that our <hi>Jeſus</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65506:33"/>whom the Jews crucified, is the <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And before I proceed to conſider the ſeveral arguments that do confirm this truth I ſhall premiſe the following particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there was a <hi>Meſſias</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the old Teſtament is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed by the Chriſtians, but granted by the Jews. There is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about this matter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that there was ſuch a perſon as <hi>Jeſus;</hi> that he lived at ſuch a time as we ſay he did, and died as the <hi>Goſpels</hi> report, is not denied by the <hi>Jews.</hi> They often mention him in their writings, though with ſcorn and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; they ſpeak of the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his death, and the names of his Diſciples; and they are far from deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter of fact.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that when <hi>Jeſus</hi> did appear in the world there was a great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> among the Jews. Thus we read of <hi>Simeon's waiting for the conſolation of Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 2.25. And that <hi>Simeon</hi> was no mean perſon, he was the Son of <hi>Hillel</hi> the great, and a man of great place among the Jews. Again, one <hi>Anna</hi> a Propheteſs, a devout and aged Widow, who ſerved
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65506:34"/>God with faſtings and prayers night and day, <hi>ſpake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jeruſalem,</hi> v. 38. The Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> had heard of this fame, and general expectation of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> among the Jews at that time; and that he ſhould be a great Prophet. <hi>I know,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is come he will tell us all things,</hi> Joh. 4. 25. Hence the Jews at that time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a general expectation of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> were very prone to take others for him that did then appear. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was a man of great vertue and fame, and that was greatly followed by the people, and that in the very time when the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caſaubon.</hi> Exercit. ad Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii</hi> Annal. n. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>they ſent Prieſts and Levites to know who he was,</hi> Joh. 1.19. That is, to know whether or no he were the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as appears from what follows. <hi>And he confeſſed, and denied not, but confeſſed I am not the Chriſt,</hi> v. 20. And there have been thoſe that have thought that <hi>Herod</hi> was by ſome taken for the <hi>Meſſias</hi> alſo, by them who upon that ſcore are called the <hi>Herodians</hi> in the Goſpel. I ſhall not need to diſpute that, ſo much is certain that the Jews
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65506:34"/>did expect the <hi>Meſſias</hi> at that time. And I ſhall afterwards ſhew what ground they had ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>It ſhall be enough at preſent to add, that as there was a general expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> about that time, ſo there were a great number of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours that took that occaſion to delude the people, and draw followers after them. <hi>Gamaliel</hi> names two, <hi>Theudas,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> Act. 5.36, 37. <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives us a farther account of theſe men. He tells us that under the government of <hi>Fadus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antiqu. l. <hi>20.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> a certain Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician called <hi>Theudas</hi> perſwaded a great number to follow. him to the river <hi>Jordan;</hi> pretending himſelf to be a Prophet, and that he would divide the River and give them the advantage of paſſing over it. This the Impoſtour did to his own deſtruction, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his followers.<note place="margin">Ib. c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> He tells us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that under the government of <hi>Felix</hi> there were certain Magicians and Impoſtours that perſwaded the people to follow them into the Wilderneſs, promiſing them to ſhew them ſigns and wonders not without the hand of God, whom ſome believed to their own hurt. He tells us in the ſame Chapter
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65506:35"/>that at that time there came a certain man from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to be a Prophet, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the people to follow him to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> making them a promiſe that there they ſhould ſee the walls of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to fall down at his command, and give them by that means a free paſſage to the City: and this happened alſo to the deſtruction of many of his followers.</p>
               <p>He tells us of another Magician in the time of <hi>Feſtus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. c. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> who promiſed to ſave his followers and to deliver them from their evils, if they would follow him into the Wilderneſs. And that thereupon both the deceiver and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived were deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>He tells us of another,<note place="margin">De Bello Judaic. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> whoſe name was <hi>Jonathan,</hi> by trade a <hi>Weaver,</hi> who pretended to ſigns and wonders.</p>
               <p>They were very prone to believe falſe people, who had rejected our bleſſed Saviour the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world. And this continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome time. And indeed there being ſo great expectation of a Saviour, it is the leſs to be wondred at that they, who had rejected the Saviour whom God ſent, ſhould entertain thoſe that came without his authority. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65506:35"/>had ſaid, <hi>I am come in my father' name, and ye receive me not: if anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> ſhall come in his own name him ye will receive,</hi> Joh. 5.43. The Jews verified our Saviour's words: and have been from time to time miſerably baffled in their expectations, and impoſed upon by Cheats and Impoſtours; as I may have a farther occaſion to repreſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſo it is that in the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſtianity they had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temptation to give credit to falſe Prophets, becauſe as they had rejected the true Prophet, ſo they continued ſtill in expectation of one that ſhould ſave them. It is very remarkable which <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his book of the Jews Wars tells us to my preſent purpoſe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That that which chiefly excited the Jews to war with the <hi>Romans</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a prophecy (though of doubtfull ſignification, as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call it, yet) contained in the Holy Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> i. e. <hi>That at that time one of their own Countrey ſhould have dominion over the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things are no more than what our Saviour foretold, and do ſhew us
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65506:36"/>what need there was of our Saviour's words. He tells the Jews. <hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and wonders, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very elect,</hi> Matt. 24.24. Evil men took hold of that occaſion to deceive the people, who being in a great expectation of a Saviour at that time were the more prone to hearken to thoſe deceivers that did ariſe. And the Jews being in expectation of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour that ſhould erect a Temporal Kingdom among them, and give them dominion over their enemies, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 17.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.6.) were by that means very forward to liſten to them that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to give them the upper hand of their enemies, and to ſet them free from the bondage they were under at that time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that in the old Teſtament the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is ſo particularly deſcribed, that it might be known, by comparing thoſe deſcriptions with the event, who was the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant that the promiſes of a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the deſcriptions of him were not given out all at once: But theſe things were diſpenſed in the ſeveral ages of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65506:36"/>World, in ſuch meaſure and after ſuch a manner as ſeemed fit to the wiſedom of God: And it cannot be denied that the Firſt diſcoveries were more general, and leſs determinate; and as the time drew near, in which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be manifeſted; ſo theſe diſcoveries were more particular, and more plain. God did not reveal theſe things all at once, but at ſundry times and after divers manners.</p>
               <p>The ſame method,<note place="margin">Maimon. H. Mela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim. <hi>c.</hi> 9. Coſri <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 38.</note> as the Jews tell us, God did take in revealing his law: Thoſe precepts which the Jews were obliged to, they ſay, were not delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all at once: For they tell that thus it was, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi> received ſix precepts (that is, ſix of thoſe which the Jews call the precepts of the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi>) and they were, that againſt <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,</hi> againſt <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> againſt <hi>ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloud,</hi> againſt <hi>fornication,</hi> and <hi>rapine,</hi> and that concerning <hi>judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> But then <hi>Noah</hi> received the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, which forbids him <hi>fleſh</hi> with the <hi>life</hi> or <hi>bloud</hi> thereof, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.4.) Thus things ſtood untill <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time: But he received beſides what were named before the precept of <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> and practiſed that of <hi>morning-prayer:</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65506:37"/>after him <hi>Iſaac</hi> did ſet aſide <hi>tithes,</hi>

               <p>I am not much concerned to enquire how far this account that the Jews give, of the gradual diſpenſing of their law, is true. I ſhall ſhew you that God took this method in promiſing the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and giving the Jews notice of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; and that however the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were more obſcure being more general and indeterminate, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God gave the Jews a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and a more clear and expreſs notice of him, that they might, and we alſo, by a diligent comparing of events with predictions know him when he came. And to that purpoſe I ſhall lay before you what God did in the ſeveral ages of the world.</p>

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:65506:37"/>The firſt promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was preſently upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion: And he is promiſed as the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> that ſhould <hi>break the ſerpent's head,</hi> (Gen. 3.15.) And this was done juſt upon man's fall; God took care betimes to give notice of the means of man's recovery. This onely inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates that he ſhould appear in our nature, and overcome our enemy, but it does not tell us of what family or lineage he ſhall be. But then in the time of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is promiſed again, and it will be worth our while to conſider with what variety the promiſe is made. The promiſe in one place runs thus, <hi>In thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> (Gen. 12.3.) This was the firſt promiſe which was made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> But then we find this promiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed afterward, but yet differently expreſſed, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 22.18. The reaſon of which variety ſeems to be this; that when the firſt promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was made to <hi>Abram, Iſaac</hi> was not born, and therefore it was ſaid, <hi>in thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> But after this <hi>Abram</hi>'s name is changed, and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Son of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65506:38"/>the promiſe is born, and <hi>Abraham</hi> had in obedience to God offered up this Son; and now God renews to him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the <hi>Meſſias: In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> God had juſt before promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> to multiply his poſterity, <hi>v.</hi> 17. but then what follows, (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with a particular reference to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> and therewithall as containing a preciſe and particular promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> (Gal. 3.16.) For thoſe words <hi>In thy ſeed</hi> (v. 18.) are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the latitude, that the ſame words, <hi>thy ſeed</hi> (v. 17.) are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in, but in a particular and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſenſe, as takes in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and in him the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And this obſervation, by the way, may ſerve for the better underſtanding thoſe words, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. Nor is this all the variety neither in theſe ſeveral promiſes of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> For, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. 'tis ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>they ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> But, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. 'tis ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>they ſhall bleſs themſelves.</hi> And after the ſame manner is the promiſe renewed to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 26.4. That is they ſhall think themſelves bleſſed in the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the ſource and fountain of bleſſing. And thus as the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65506:38"/>promiſed at firſt as the <hi>ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and a conquerour of the ſerpent; ſo he was promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to <hi>Iſaac</hi> as the <hi>fountain of bleſſing:</hi> And then if we proceed we ſhall find that <hi>Iſaac</hi> in his bleſſing to <hi>Jacob</hi> does not forget to tranſmit the bleſſing of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to him and to his ſeed with him, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 28.4.) which was confirmed by God, <hi>v.</hi> 14. This bleſſing <hi>Jacob</hi> does not forget at ſuch time as he bleſſed his Children, but mentions it in the bleſſing of <hi>Judah;</hi> and withall gives ſome account of the time of the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (under the name of <hi>Shiloh</hi>) and of the obedience that ſhould be yielded to him, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10.) After this we have a prediction from the mouth of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who was ſent for indeed to curſe the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> yet does he bleſs them and predict the great bleſſing of the <hi>Meſſias: There ſhall come a ſtar out of Jacob, and a ſceptre ſhall riſe out of Iſrael, and ſhall ſmite the corners of Moab, and deſtroy all the children of Seth,</hi> (Numb. 24.17.) A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, we have ſtill a more particular account that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be a great Prophet, and that we have from <hi>Moſes</hi> the greateſt Prophet. <hi>The Lord
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65506:39"/>thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet, from the midſt of thee, of thy brethren like unto me,</hi> (Deut. 18.15.) And it follows, <hi>and will put my words in his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto them all that I ſhall command him. And it ſhall come to paſs that whoſoever will not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto my words, which he ſhall ſpeak in my name, I will require it of him,</hi> v. 18, 19. After this the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is promiſed under the character of a <hi>King,</hi> (1 Sam. 2.10.) And a <hi>King</hi> of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 1 Chro. 17. Pſal. 72. and 132. So that now we have ſome account of the <hi>office</hi> and of the <hi>lineage</hi> and <hi>family</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> He is promiſed as a <hi>Prophet</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a <hi>King</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> too in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> Pſal. 110.4. His <hi>offices,</hi> and his <hi>tribe</hi> and <hi>lineage</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus predicted we ſhall find after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and eſpecially as the time of his appearance drew near, many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars predicted, and ſometimes very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute ones alſo relating to his <hi>birth,</hi> and to his <hi>life,</hi> to his <hi>miracles</hi> and the <hi>place</hi> of his <hi>converſe,</hi> to his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> his <hi>reſurrection</hi> and <hi>aſcenſion,</hi> and the <hi>great ſucceſs</hi> of his undertaking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Gentile</hi> world. That he ſhould
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65506:39"/>be born in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> tell us, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.2. And of a Virgin the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Iſa. 7.14. That he ſhould come before the Jewiſh polity were quite deſtroyed <hi>Jacob</hi> had predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10.) And that he ſhould come while the <hi>Second Temple</hi> ſtood <hi>Haggai</hi> aſſures us, (<hi>Hag.</hi> 2.) And that the time of his appearing was about the time when our Saviour <hi>Jeſus</hi> appeared we may learn from the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> (Dan. 9.) And that he ſhould come ſuddenly into his <hi>Temple</hi> the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> aſſures us, (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1.) We have a prediction of his <hi>forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> (Iſa. 40.) Of his coming <hi>back from Egypt,</hi> Hoſ. 11.1. And of the ſlaughter of the <hi>Innocents,</hi> Jer. 31.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould converſe much in <hi>Galilee</hi> is foretold, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.1. What <hi>works</hi> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould doe is predicted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.7.35.5, 6. That he ſhould be a great <hi>Prophet,</hi> Deut. 18. That he ſhould be a <hi>prince of peace,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. A moſt <hi>righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Iſa. 11.5.

               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:65506:40"/>That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be deſpiſed and rejected by his own people, that he ſhould appear in a <hi>low, ſervile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And then for his <hi>death,</hi> that is not onely foretold but the manner and minuteſt circumſtances of it alſo. That he ſhould be <hi>crucified,</hi> (Zech. 12.10. Pſ. 22.16.) That he ſhould be <hi>betrayed</hi> by his diſciple and familiar, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.9.) That he ſhould be ſold for <hi>thirty pieces of ſilver,</hi> (Zech. 11.12.) And <hi>crucified</hi> among <hi>thieves,</hi> (Iſa. 53.12.) That on the Croſs they ſhould give him <hi>vinegar to drink,</hi> (Pſ. 69.21.) That his <hi>garments</hi> ſhould be <hi>parted,</hi> and that <hi>lots ſhould be caſt</hi> upon his <hi>veſture,</hi> (Pſal. 18.22.) That he ſhould be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided</hi> and <hi>ſcoffed at</hi> even when he was under his ſufferings, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.7, 8.) That he ſhould <hi>intercede</hi> for <hi>tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours,</hi> Iſa. 53.12. That he ſhould ſuffer with a <hi>Lamb-like meekneſs,</hi> Iſa. 53.7.

               <p>That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be <hi>buried</hi> is alſo foretold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. And <hi>honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably</hi> interred alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.9. And that he ſhould <hi>riſe</hi> again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7.16.10.

               <p>Theſe things are predicted of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in the old Teſtament; we are now to conſider whether we can find them fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And if we do we may very ſafely conclude that this <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not doubt (with God's aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) not onely to ſhew that theſe things were fulfilled in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but that they were alſo fulfilled by a moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious providence of God; that we muſt be forced to ſay, This was the Lord's doing, and it may well be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in our eyes.</p>

                  <p>Of the birth of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Of his lineage and kindred. Of the place of his birth.

               <p>I Shall firſt of all conſider the birth of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſee whether in that particular the predictions of old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi> were fulfilled in him or not.

                  </note> Thus he is called <hi>a root of Jeſſe,</hi> Iſa. 11.10. A righteous branch raiſed up to <hi>David,</hi> Jer. 23.5. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> alſo, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23. And no wonder then that he ſhould be ſaid to be of the <hi>tribe of Judah,</hi> Mic. 5.2. God had made a ſolemn and unalterable promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> unto <hi>David,</hi> and that he ſhould be of his ſeed. <hi>I have made a covenant with my choſen, I have ſworn unto David my ſervant: Thy ſeed will I eſtabliſh for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations,</hi> Pſal. 89.3, 4. Theſe words are too great to have their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion in <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the ſucceeding Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> who were of <hi>David</hi>'s family and lineage. And it is not hard to diſcern (what a learned man hath obſerved) that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> does diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>ſeed,</hi> and <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>ſons:</hi> By his <hi>ſeed</hi> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is to be meant; and what is ſaid of his <hi>ſeed</hi> is to be underſtood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> having a preciſe reference to him; but what is ſaid of his <hi>ſons,</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his deſcendants and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours; and the promiſes made to them are <hi>conditional;</hi> that of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> who was to be of his family was <hi>abſolute.</hi> Thus 'tis ſaid, <hi>His ſeed alſo
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65506:42"/>will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven,</hi> v. 29. The kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall never fail, and nothing ſhall hinder his being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the world. But then for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's ſons,</hi> viz. <hi>Solomon</hi> and his other off-ſpring it follows, <hi>If his children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my law, and walk not in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if they break my ſtatutes and keep not my commandments, then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with a rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes,</hi> v. 30, 31, 32. This will God doe with the Sons of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to whom his promiſes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to them, were but conditional; but then it follows, <hi>Nevertheleſs my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have ſworn by my holineſs, that I will not lie unto David. His ſeed ſhall endure for ever, and his throne as the Sun before me. It ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever as the Moon, and as a faithfull witneſs in heaven,</hi> v. 33.—37. Now for our <hi>Jeſus</hi> it is evident, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Jews, that he was of the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>David.</hi> When <hi>Gabriel</hi> went to the bleſſed Virgin, it is ſaid that he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65506:42"/>went to a <hi>Virgin eſpouſed to a man whoſe name was Joſeph, of the houſe of David,</hi> Luk. 1.27. And <hi>Zacharias</hi> does bleſs God for raiſing up an <hi>horn of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in the houſe of his ſervant David,</hi> v. 69. The Goſpel begins, <hi>The book of the generation of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of David,</hi> Matt. 1.1. By this name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was called frequently: <hi>Thou ſon of David have mercy upon us,</hi> ſay the blind men, <hi>Matt.</hi> 9.27. And the people ſaid of him, <hi>Is not this the ſon of David?</hi> Matt. 12.23. The multitude cried out, <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the <hi>ſon of David,</hi> Mat. 21.9. See alſo <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31. The Jews knew very well that the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> was to be the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and the Prieſts and Scribes were diſpleaſed when they heard <hi>Jeſus</hi> called the <hi>ſon of David,</hi> Matt. 21.15. When <hi>Jeſus</hi> asked the <hi>Phariſees</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, they ſay unto him, <hi>the ſon of David,</hi> Matt. 22.42. And when there aroſe a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Jews ſaid, <hi>Hath not the Scripture ſaid that Chriſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of the ſeed of David?</hi> Joh. 7.42. And our Saviour therefore might well be called, <hi>the Lion of the tribe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah:</hi> and, <hi>the Root of David,</hi> Rev. 5.5. and the <hi>off-ſpring of David,</hi> c. 22. v. 16.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65506:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>And the authour of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> even in that Epiſtle which he writes to the Jews, ſays <hi>it is evident that our Lord ſprang out of Judah,</hi> Heb. 7.14.</p>
               <p>I grant that there is ſome difficulty in the account we have of the genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>Jeſus</hi> as it is delivered to us by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke.</hi> But thoſe are very unreaſonable men that will upon that ſcore now reject Chriſtianity. For we do not find that the Jews of old denied our <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be of the family of <hi>David,</hi> or that they accuſed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for affirming him to be of the tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> And yet it is not to be imagined that they would have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have charged the firſt Chriſtians of forgery had there been any ground for ſuch a charge. And ſure I am if the Jews could not charge the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans upon this ſcore (and that they did not is an argument that they could not doe it) they are very unreaſonable that now make the objection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I conſider the place of his birth. Of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> it is foretold that he ſhould be born not onely of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in the city or town of <hi>David</hi> alſo. Thus the Prophet tells us, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65506:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>out of Bethlehem he ſhould come forth that was to be ruler in Iſrael,</hi> Mic. 5.2. Now certain it is that the ancient Jews underſtood that Prophecy of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> whatever artifices the later Jews have uſed to evade the force of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teſtimony, of which we have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good evidence to this day. And the Chaldee Paraphraſt on the place ſpeaks plain enough in this argument, when he paraphraſeth upon thoſe words, <hi>Out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Iſrael,</hi> thus, <hi>Out of thee, before me ſhall come Meſſias</hi> (or <hi>Chriſt</hi>) <hi>that he may rule,</hi> &amp;c. and to the ſame purpoſe doth <hi>Jonathan</hi> the <hi>Targumiſt</hi> ſpeak on <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.21. where 'tis ſaid that <hi>Iſrael journied and ſpread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</hi> To which he adds theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, <hi>The place from whence the King Meſſias ſhall be revealed in the laſt days.</hi> We find <hi>Jacob</hi> at that time about <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrath,</hi> which is <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> in the way to which place <hi>Rachel</hi> died and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there, <hi>v.</hi> 19. The Tower of <hi>Edar</hi> is the <hi>tower of the flock,</hi> and thought to be the ſame which the Prophet menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Micah.</hi> 4.8. and one of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents tells us that the Tower of <hi>Edar</hi> is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65506:44"/>the place of the Shepherds near unto <hi>Bethlehem</hi> (where the company of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> declared the nativity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) and that thence it had its name;<note place="margin">Hieron. <hi>Quaeſt. in</hi> Geneſ. <hi>Id. ad</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtochium <hi>Epitaph.</hi> Paul.</note> or, from <hi>Jacob</hi>'s feeding his Cattel there, <hi>vel, quod verius eſt, quodam va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticinio, futurum jam tunc myſterium mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrabatur.</hi> He tells us elſewhere expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Tower of <hi>Edar</hi> was the place where <hi>Jacob</hi> fed his flocks, and where the Shepherds, that watched by night, at the time of our Saviour's birth, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.) heard the heavenly hoſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it appears that the Jews ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected their <hi>Meſſias</hi> from <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> And when <hi>Herod</hi> demanded of the Prieſts and Scribes where <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be born, <hi>They ſaid unto him, in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the Prophet, and thou Bethlehem,</hi> &amp;c. Matt. 2.5, 6. And at another time we find the Jews ſaid, <hi>Hath not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaid that Chriſt cometh of the ſeed of David, and out of the town of Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem where David was?</hi> Joh. 7.42. And there was our Saviour born, though it were unlikely it ſhould have been ſo. For he was conceived in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> there
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65506:44"/>his Mother lived, and there one would have thought ſhe ſhould have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: but God had otherwiſe decreed, and he by his wiſe providence brought it to paſs. For ſo it was that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made a decree for the enrolling or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the names of his ſubjects and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, upon which account <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> removed from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where they lived, unto <hi>Bethlehem</hi> a town of their own tribe, and there was <hi>Mary</hi> delivered; there was our Saviour born, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.1.—7. And thus did God make <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> an inſtrument to fulfill his decree when he himſelf knew it not; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> fulfills a Prophecy by this means which he had not heard of.</p>
               <p>But this providence of God is ſtill the more remarkable if we conſider far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what hath been obſerved concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the decree of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> to this purpoſe. You are to this purpoſe to know that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had decreed that 27 years before the birth of <hi>Chriſt</hi> there ſhould have been an enrolling of the whole Empire, and proclaimed it in <hi>Tarracon</hi> a City of <hi>Spain</hi> after the <hi>Cantabri</hi> had been conquered and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by him; for that he conceived a fit time, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire being then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65506:45"/>at quiet: But finding afterwards a brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of ſome ſtirs he deferred it to this time when our Saviour was born. Had it been done before, there might have been no need of it now. And then <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> had not had the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of going up to <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> But what ſhall we ſay? <hi>This was the Lord's doing, and it may well be wonderfull in our eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I conſider the ſtupendious manner of the birth of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I ſhall againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> defend St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s quotation of the Prophet <hi>Micah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very true there is ſome variety in the words (as they are laid before us by St. <hi>Matthew</hi>) both from the words as they are read in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copy in the Prophet, as alſo from the <hi>Greek</hi> interpreters. But the difference between them ſeems greater than it is: And I ſhall account for the difference before I paſs to another matter.</p>
               <p>And to my preſent purpoſe it will be needfull onely to obſerve theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What in the Prophet is called <hi>Bethlehem Ephratah:</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in the land of <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is of little moment: <hi>Ephratah</hi> and <hi>Bethlehem</hi> were but two names of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65506:45"/>the ſame place, as appears from <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.19. <hi>Ruth</hi> 4.11. And though <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phratah</hi> were an ancient name of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi> before the captivity, yet it is to be conſidered that it might not be ſo well known to <hi>Herod,</hi> who is upon the inquiry after the place of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s birth; and for his certain information he is told that <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judaea</hi> was It. And when inſtead of <hi>Bethlehem Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tah,</hi> as it is in <hi>Micah,</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls it <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> he ſpeaks of the ſame place more diſtinctly than the Prophet had done in his words. There was another <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in the tribe of <hi>Zabulon,</hi> (Joſh. 19.15.) In diſtinction from which this is called <hi>Bethlehem Judah,</hi> Judg. 17.7.19.1. And ſince the enquiry was concerning the place of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s birth (who was to be born of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> Gen. 49.10.) no wonder that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſhould expreſs it thus.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The place which in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> is called <hi>Little,</hi> in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> is called <hi>not the Leaſt.</hi> And though there appears not ſo great a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two expreſſions as we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, yet as the words lie in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the Prophet, and eſpecially
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65506:46"/>as they are tranſlated by the <hi>Greek</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters compared with the Text of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> there ſeems to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. 'Tis <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>For the removing this difficulty I ſhall not repeat the various ways which learned men have taken: I ſhall menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two which bid the faireſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt by rendring the words in <hi>Micah</hi> which we tranſlate, <hi>though thou be little among the thouſands,</hi> &amp;c. Thus, It is little that thou ſhouldeſt be (<hi>i. e.</hi> be reckoned) <hi>among the thouſands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> This is too mean a thing for thee, <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> from whom ſhall ſpring the ruler of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This makes the ſenſe the ſame with St. <hi>Matthew</hi> without any violence to the Text.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I rather chuſe another way, and I ſhall deliver it in my Authour's own words.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock <hi>on</hi> Micah 5. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The plaineſt way of reconciling them</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſeems that, which a learned Jew, who probably never knew what is written in St.</hi> Matthew, <hi>and would certainly never have ſtrained to ſay what ſhould make for juſtifying the Goſpel,</hi> or advantage of Chriſtians, <hi>gives us; which is this, that</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies <hi>little</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> or, <hi>of great
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65506:46"/>note and eſteem; and yet in this latter ſenſe it is here to be underſtood in this place. That the word hath both theſe ſignifications he proves by inſtancing in other places in which, though it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifies</hi> little, <hi>it is to be rendred</hi> great, <hi>or</hi> Chief, <hi>or</hi> Prince. <hi>The ſame is affirmed by others of good authority, and among the chief Maſters of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which nothing ſhall need to be added but what the ſame Authour ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins preſently afterward. <hi>With great emphaſis</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſeems that word here put which ſignifies at once both little and great, or of great renown, to ſhew that, as ſome other things, which are little in bulk or quantity, yet in other regards are of more eſteem and value above others in ſight greater; ſo it was with</hi> Bethlehem <hi>though perhaps otherwiſe little in number, bigneſs or account among the thouſands of</hi> Judah, or as St. <hi>Matthew, among the Princes of Judah. Which in ſenſe is all one, alluding to the cuſtome of the</hi> Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites <hi>of dividing their tribes into thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands (as among us the Shires are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Hundreds) over every one of which thouſands was a Prince or Chief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65506:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thus is the difficulty of reconciling St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Micah</hi> abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and that by a way which the Jews themſelves cannot reaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I conſider the ſtupendious manner of his birth. For this was alſo foretold of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that he ſhould be born of a <hi>Virgin.</hi> This God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed long before to the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> I ſay to the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> for that is to be very well heeded: 'Twas to the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> not to <hi>Ahaz</hi> that this promiſe was made.

                  <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son and ſhall call his name Immanuel,</hi> Iſa. 7.11.—14. By which words it is very evident, as one of the Ancients hath obſerved well, that what is ſaid here is ſaid to the houſe of <hi>David.</hi> Now
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65506:47"/>the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> though ſhe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed eſpouſed to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> yet <hi>before they came together ſhe was found with Child of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Matt. 1.18. And the ſame Evangeliſt tells us expreſly, <hi>All this was done that it might be fulfilled, which was ſpoken of the Lord by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſaying, Behold a Virgin ſhall be with Child,</hi> &amp;c. v. 22, 23. It was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the character of the <hi>ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that the firſt promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And this was made good in the birth of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of a <hi>Virgin;</hi> who was in the ſtricteſt ſenſe the ſeed of the woman; for though the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> were eſpouſed to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> yet <hi>before they came together</hi> ſhe was found with Child of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Thus as <hi>ſin</hi> entred by a <hi>woman</hi> ſo did <hi>ſalvation</hi> alſo. And God made a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the inſtrument of the greateſt good, as the firſt Woman was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the greateſt evil. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was then firſt in the tranſgreſſion, and now ſhe is alſo made of God an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the greateſt bleſſing to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: we are ſaved now by the fruit of a Woman's womb, as we were made miſerable at firſt by a Woman's rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus the Apoſtle tells us that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65506:48"/>the Woman ſhall be ſaved in <hi>Child-bearing:</hi> And there being a difficulty in that expreſſion I ſhall offer ſomething upon this occaſion towards its explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Apoſtle requires that the woman ſhould <hi>learn in ſilence with all ſubjection,</hi> (1 Tim. 2.11.) and adds; <hi>But I ſuffer not a woman to teach, nor to uſurp authority over the man, but to be in ſilence,</hi> v. 12. This may ſeem hard on the woman's ſide, and therefore the Apoſtle, to ſhew that what he required of the woman was not arbitrarily done, gives the reaſons why he enjoins the woman this ſilence and ſubjection; and gives two reaſons: The firſt is that the woman by God was made ſubject to man, and was ſo even by the very law of her creation, and would have ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued had mankind continued in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. <hi>For Adam was firſt formed, then Eve,</hi> v. 13. The ſecond reaſon for this injunction of ſilence and ſubjection is the woman's tranſgreſſion: This rendred her condition more mean and worſe than it was by the law of her creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. She is now ſubjected for her fault, and depreſſed lower than ſhe was upon the ſcore of her tranſgreſſion: God ſaid to the woman upon her fall, <hi>Thy deſire
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65506:48"/>ſhall be to thy husband, and he ſhall rule over three,</hi> Gen. 3.16. Thus ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the tranſgreſſion,</hi> v. 14. By all which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the woman's condition ſince the fall is very bad, and upon ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts worſe than that of the man's. But yet though it be much depreſſed 'tis not deplorable and hopeleſs: It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Notwithſtanding ſhe ſhall be ſaved in Child-bearing, if they continue in faith, and charity, and holineſs with ſobriety,</hi> v. 15. <hi>She ſhall be ſaved in Child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> not that the woman's bearing of children were either a means or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her being ſaved; this would be ſmall comfort to thoſe who bear none. But ſhe ſhall be ſaved by this Saviour who was born of a woman and is the promiſed ſeed. 'Tis <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by this Son born of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> this promiſed ſeed, who is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith and hope. And then what follows, <hi>If they continue in faith and charity, and holineſs with ſobriety,</hi> does but inſinuate the condition required on the woman's part. The principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or promiſed ſeed; this is the mean of our ſalvation,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65506:49"/>and the foundation of our hope; but <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> are required as <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> are required as <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> on our part.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I conſider the time in which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to come accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the promiſes and predictions of the old Teſtament. And here I ſhall conſider, what the time predicted was; and then ſhew you that 'tis paſt long ſince; and, that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> did appear at that time, according to the general expectation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin, and ſhew what the time was in which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to come according to the predictions of the old Teſtament. And to that purpoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your conſideration thoſe places of Scripture which give us an account of that time. And I ſhall begin with the words of <hi>Jacob: The ſceptre ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, untill Shiloh come,</hi> Gen. 49.10. That thoſe words are to be underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers of the Jews do confeſs, and the modern Jews know this very well: And ſeveral of them have alſo interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the place of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Though there have been ſome among them who have uſed their wits to elude the force
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65506:49"/>of that divine Teſtimony. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe words of <hi>Jacob</hi> is as if he had ſaid, The Jews (who near the time of and after their return from their captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> received their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination from <hi>Judah</hi>) ſhall not ceaſe to be a people, nor be quite deprived of the uſe of their Laws and Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall come among them. This is the natural and unforced ſenſe of theſe words: Now we know that forty years after the death of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Jews were overcome by the <hi>Romans,</hi> their City and Temple burnt; ſince which time they have been diſperſed and ſcattered, and are not at this day, nor have they been for many ages any diſtinct Polity or Commonwealth. Let them in this confute us if they can: Let them tell us where their Nation dwells, where it is that they are either a <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Republick,</hi> or <hi>Body Politick:</hi> Let them ſhew us their Sceptre, their marks and enſigns of government and authority? We know they are a ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd people, that their City and Land are in the poſſeſſions of ſtrangers, and that they live under the laws and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the ſeveral Countries in which they are. The <hi>Prophet</hi> is more
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65506:50"/>particular and preciſe in this affair, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>Gabriel</hi> informs that <hi>Prophet</hi> of the time of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> For there we ſhall not need to be beholden to the Jews to grant us that <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> for he calls him <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and <hi>Meſſiah the Prince.</hi> His words to <hi>Daniel</hi> are theſe. <hi>Seventy weeks are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finiſh the tranſgreſſion and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for iniquity, and to bring in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t from the going forth of the commandment to reſtore and to build Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, unto the Meſſiah the Prince, ſhall be ſeven weeks: And threeſcore and two weeks the ſtreets ſhall be built again, and the wall even in troublous times. And after threeſcore and two weeks ſhall Meſſiah be cut off but not for himſelf: And the people of the Prince ſhall come, and ſhall deſtroy the city and the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the end thereof ſhall be with a floud, and unto the end of the wars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations are determined. And he ſhall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midſt of the week he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65506:50"/>ſhall cauſe the ſacrifice and the oblation to ceaſe, and for the overſpreading of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations he ſhall make it deſolate, even untill the conſummation, and that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſhall be poured upon the deſolate,</hi> (v. 24, 25, 26, 27.) That the time mentioned by <hi>Gabriel</hi> hath a particular reference to <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be granted it being expreſs. And then let men but compute the time and they will ſoon find that <hi>Gabriel</hi>'s words give an account of a time that is long ſince paſt, and that they are words that give ſuch a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time as muſt have its expiration about that time when our <hi>Jeſus</hi> was in the fleſh. Another teſtimony we have from the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> chap. 2. It is well known that the <hi>ſecond Temple</hi> came very much ſhort of the glory of the <hi>firſt;</hi> and yet there we find a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that the glory of that ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be greater than that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s; which could not be otherwiſe true than that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (a greater than <hi>Soloman</hi>) was to come into it, and honour it with his preſence. Let us conſider the words. <hi>I will ſhake all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the deſire of all nations ſhall come, and I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. The ſilver is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65506:51"/>mine, and the gold is mine, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. The glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater than of the former, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, and in this place will I give peace, ſaith the Lord of hoſts,</hi> v. 7, 8, 9. The glory muſt be with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or upon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account: Upon other accounts this houſe was ſo far from exceeding the glory of the firſt Temple, that the Jews mention ſeveral particulars in which this ſecond Temple fell ſhort of the firſt. And therefore the promiſed glory muſt refer to the coming and preſence of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And thus we reade in <hi>Malachy,</hi> chap. 3.— <hi>The Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to this temple; even the meſſenger of the covenant whom ye delight in, behold he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of hoſts,</hi> v. 1. It will appear by what hath been ſaid that the time is lapſed long ago in which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to come. For <hi>Daniel</hi>'s weeks they are expired whatever <hi>Epocha</hi> we frame for their beginning: And the people of the Jews have been vanquiſhed and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and their City, and that very Temple into which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to come were committed to the flames a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſixteen hundred years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:65506:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>But then our <hi>Jeſus</hi> lived when the Jews were a <hi>Polity,</hi> and while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their <hi>own laws,</hi> and in their <hi>own land.</hi> He went into that <hi>Temple</hi> which the Prophet mentions, and did appear among the Jews before their Sceptre was departed, and at an age and time when there was a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of ſome great perſon among the <hi>Gentile world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there was at that time, when <hi>Jeſus</hi> appeared, a great expectation of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> among the Jews I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already: And I ſhall now obſerve farther ſtill that there was even among the Heathens an expectation of ſome great perſon that ſhould appear in that age in which our <hi>Jeſus</hi> lived. And of the truth of this we have very good te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies from ſundry Authours. I ſhall not inſiſt upon the predictions of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> which were among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then people. Thus much is certain, that there was in that age a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſome extraordinary perſon. When <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (in whoſe time our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was born) ſent to the <hi>Oracle</hi> to know who ſhould reign after him he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an anſwer to this purpoſe. <hi>That

And upon the whole it ſeems very plain, that the ground of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation was to be fetched from the predictions in the old Teſtament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to be born. Theſe Prophecies were ſo plain, that they raiſed in the Jews a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65506:53"/>expectation of their <hi>Meſſias</hi> at that time; and they did withall ſignifie the hope they had of his appearance, and hence the fame of that expectation was ſpread abroad in the <hi>Gentile</hi> world.</p>
               <p>We ſee that the birth of our <hi>Jeſus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees very well with what was predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> I ſhall therefore now proceed to ſome other particulars.</p>
               <p>But before I do that I cannot but take notice how the Jews ſhuffle when they are urged with the Scriptures above mentioned, which predicted the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the words of <hi>Jacob,</hi> (Gen. 49.10.) it is evident that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to come while the Jews were a people, and before they were diſperſed. Their ancient Doctours expound thoſe words of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> with one conſent. The time is elapſed, and for ſixteen hundred years they have been driven out of their own land and (many of their laws being annexed to that land) been forced to live where they could not put in practice the laws of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Menaſſeh Ben Iſrael <hi>Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor pa.</hi> 88.</note> And now they have found out arts and tricks to elude the force of that place, which their ancient writers underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which are ſo vain and weak
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65506:53"/>that I will not reckon them up, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader to one of their late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on this argument.</p>
               <p>It is infinitely plain that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to come during the ſecond Temple, according to <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Malachy.</hi> It is certain that the glory of that latter Houſe was to be greater than that of the former. And there can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account given how this could be, but that it ſhould be from the preſence of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> who was to appear in this Temple. For otherwiſe this Temple came ſhort of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, and they who knew <hi>Solomon</hi>'s wept when they ſaw the foundation of this, (<hi>Ezra</hi> 3.3, 12.) Nay the Jewiſh writers tell us (and fanſie that they learn it from the defect of the letter <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:65506:54"/>They anſwer that the ſecond Temple ſtood longer than the firſt,<note place="margin">Kimchi <hi>&amp;</hi> R.

As if the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten years longer were a thing in it ſelf of ſo great moment, and ſo great a comfort to thoſe who ſaw its foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Suppoſing the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be true that it ſtood ten years longer than that of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, yet does not this infer the glory which is here promiſed: Is this all that is meant by thoſe words, <hi>I will fill this houſe with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</hi> The Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the account of <hi>Maimon.</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued longer than 410 years,<note place="margin">Maimon.

I will raiſe them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth, and he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65506:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhall ſpeak unto them all that I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him,</hi> Deut. 18.18.

                  </note> that the Prophet, of whom another Prophet hath teſtified, is to be preſumed a Prophet and needs not to be examined. And then this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Moſes,</hi> their greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet muſt needs be very worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, ſince it can belong to none (as will appear afterwards) ſo peculiarly as to our Bleſſed Saviour; who made it appear that he was that Prophet which was promiſed in thoſe words: And we find our Saviour appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he preached the things concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.27, 44. And he lets the Jews know that the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> will condemn them. <hi>Do not think</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that I will accuſe you to the Father, there is one that accuſeth you even Moſes in whom ye truſt. For had ye believed Moſes ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me. But if ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not his writings, how ſhall ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my words?</hi> Joh. 5.45, 46, 47. It is very evident that the Jews look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a Prophet at that time, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.21.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65506:56"/>And the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> intimates no leſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.25. And the Jews confeſs that he <hi>was of a truth that Prophet that ſhould come into the world,</hi> Joh. 6.14. And this general expectation of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> at that time muſt be grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the promiſe of God;<note place="margin">Juchaſin <hi>fol.</hi> 14.</note> for ſo it was (as the Jewiſh writers confeſs) that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Haggai, Zechary</hi> and <hi>Malachy</hi> Prophecy ceaſed: And that it ſhould revive again among them they had no ground to believe but what they had from the divine promiſe. And theſe words (<hi>Deut.</hi> 18.) are a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs promiſe of it; when Prophecy had ceaſed ſo long a time yet they are aſſured that God would <hi>raiſe them up a Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now our Saviour was that <hi>Prophet:</hi> And he gave great proofs that he was a Prophet: He taught the will of God, and ſpake as never man ſpake, and did mightily exceed the <hi>Scribes</hi> in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, who were a ſort of men that came the neareſt to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> Mat. 7.29. We find our Lord preaching his Sermon on the Mount, (<hi>Matt.</hi> 5.) declaring the acceptable year of the Lord, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 4.19.) He ſpake to the wonder of his hearers, with great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65506:57"/>and aſſurance; with a mighty power and great conviction. And whereas the <hi>Prophets</hi> were wont to ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> Our Saviour hath it, <hi>I ſay unto you;</hi> not like an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Prophet,</hi> but like the <hi>great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and Biſhop of our ſouls,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.4. Heb. 13.20. 1 Pet. 2.25. He farther ſhewed himſelf a <hi>Prophet</hi> as he foretold things to come. And this he did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and the things came to paſs, and he appeared to be a true <hi>Prophet.</hi> Thus he foretold the denial of <hi>Peter,</hi> (<hi>Matt.</hi> 26.75.) the treachery of <hi>Judas,</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.70, 71.) his own <hi>death</hi> and <hi>reſurrection,</hi> (Matt. 16.21.) Aye, and after that, the deſtruction of the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> with the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that ſhould go before it, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24.) And the falſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> that ſhould ariſe, of which there have been conſiderable numbers from time to time. He tells the Jews that though they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, who came in his Father's name, yet, ſays he, <hi>If another ſhall come in his own name him ye will receive,</hi> (Joh. 5.43.) The poor Jews have wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully experimented the truth of thoſe words of our Saviour, having been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by Impoſtours from time
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65506:57"/>to time to their great loſs and miſchief, as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew more at large afterwards. Thus did our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our make it appear that he was a true <hi>Prophet</hi> in that his predictions were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the event of things.<note place="margin">

If <hi>he</hi> were meek <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>lowly</hi> in heart. If <hi>Moſes</hi> appeared when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were under the <hi>bondage</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> ſo did <hi>Jeſus</hi> when they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Roman power.</hi> If <hi>Moſes</hi> gave his law from a <hi>Mountain,</hi> our Saviour preached his Sermon on a <hi>Mount.</hi> If <hi>Moſes</hi> had his <hi>ſeventy Elders, Jeſus</hi> had his <hi>ſeventy Diſciples.</hi> If <hi>Moſes</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and murmured at by his <hi>own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> our Saviour came <hi>unto his own, and his own received him not.</hi> If <hi>Moſes</hi> tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on <hi>Pharaoh's Crown</hi> and deſpiſed the pleaſures of his Court, our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be <hi>made a King,</hi> and deſpiſed all the glory of this world. As the face of <hi>Moſes</hi> did <hi>ſhine,</hi> ſo did the face of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> (Compare <hi>Ex.</hi> 34.35. with <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.2.) And as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſigned the death of the <hi>males</hi> among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that he might deſtroy the deliverer of that people, ſo did <hi>Herod</hi> deſtroy them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> returns into <hi>Egypt</hi> upon the death of thoſe who ſought his life, ſo does <hi>Jeſus</hi> into his Countrey upon the death of <hi>Herod.</hi> But there are other things in which our <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was like unto <hi>Moſes.</hi> Viz.</p>

               <p>In his <hi>Mediatourſhip.</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the <hi>Iſraelites, I ſtood between the Lord and you at that time to ſhew you the word of the Lord,</hi> Deut. 5.5. And in this he was but the type of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, who exceeded him greatly, inaſmuch as he is the Mediatour of a better Covenant, which <hi>was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8.6.</p>
               <p>I may add, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a type of our bleſſed Saviour in the deliverance which he wrought. He delivered his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65506:59"/>people from <hi>Egypt,</hi> but <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaves us from our <hi>ſins.</hi> He ſaved the <hi>Iſraelites, Jeſus</hi> is the Saviour of the <hi>World.</hi> He wrought miracles but not ſo many and great works as thoſe which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did; as I ſhall ſhew at large after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>What hath been ſaid is ſufficient to convince us that thoſe words (<hi>Deut.</hi> 18.) belong to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and were fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in our bleſſed Saviour. I know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that the Jewiſh writers expound thoſe words to another ſenſe, and by the <hi>Prophet</hi> there they underſtand the whole order and ſucceſſion of <hi>Prophets</hi> after <hi>Moſes,</hi> or elſe <hi>Joſhuah, or Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi> But there is no ground for ſuch an interpretation of the Text. For the words ſpeak plainly of one certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that God would raiſe up; and for <hi>Joſhua</hi> he was no Prophet, nor is he juſtly reckoned among that order of men. And that the words cannot be meant of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> or of any other Prophet ſucceeding <hi>Moſes</hi> is plain from this, that they contain a promiſe not onely of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> but a <hi>Prophet</hi> like unto <hi>Moſes;</hi> which, according to the Jews conceſſion, neither <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> nor any of the other Prophets were: For
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65506:59"/>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Prophet of an higher form and rank than any of thoſe that did ſucceed him till our Saviour's time. And that this Prophet, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 18.) is not to be found among any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the old Teſtament will appear from theſe words, where it is ſaid, <hi>There aroſe not a Prophet ſince in Iſrael, like unto Moſes, whom the Lord knew face to face,</hi> (Deut. 34.10.) The ſucceeding Prophets did but repeat what <hi>Moſes</hi> had taught. His law was their rule, till <hi>Chriſt</hi> came, who ſpake what God had commanded him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the place where the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> was to converſe, when he came into the world, is alſo predicted, and we ſhall find our Saviour did converſe in that place. Though he were born in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> yet he lived in <hi>Galilee,</hi> as was predicted by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> I ſhall take the liberty to tranſlate thoſe words, as a learned man hath done, and to begin where he does alſo.<note place="margin">

Now as it were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of theſe early ſufferings they are promiſed here by the Prophet a glorious dignation from the preſence, and converſation, and preaching, and mighty works of our bleſſed Saviour. As the ſecond Temple, which fell ſhort of the firſt in glory, was to be more glorious than that by the preſence of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> ſo <hi>Galilee,</hi> though an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Countrey, and remote from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> the principal City of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Countrey that had been ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and very ſeverely afflicted, ſhould yet be dignified with the preſence and works of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:65506:60"/>We are next to enquire whether this prediction were fulfilled in our bleſſed Saviour. And to that purpoſe we read that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was ſent unto a City of <hi>Galilee,</hi> named <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who dwelt there, to acquaint her that ſhe ſhould conceive and bring forth a Son, and call his name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Luk. 1. And though <hi>Jeſus</hi> were born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> yet he was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Galilee;</hi> and from thence <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> went up to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> upon occaſion of the decree of <hi>Auguſtus Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> Luk. 2. And in <hi>Galilee</hi> again he lived when he was a young child: for after he was brought up out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he fearing to go into <hi>Judoea,</hi> being warned of God in a dream, he turned aſide into the parts of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and he came and dwelt in a City called <hi>Nazareth,</hi> Matt. 2.22, 23. From thence he came to be baptized by <hi>John,</hi> Matt. 3.13. Mark 1.9. And after his temptation and <hi>John</hi>'s impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, we find him in <hi>Galilee</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpel of the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.14. Or, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it, <hi>In the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by Iſaias the Prophet,

                  <note place="margin">Euſeb. <hi>Demonſtr. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The land of Zabulon and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the ſea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the people which ſate in darkneſs ſaw great light</hi>— Matt. 4.14, 15, 16. As there he had been brought up, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.39.4.16. ſo there he preached, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.23. At the Sea of <hi>Galilee</hi> he calls <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Andrew;</hi> and a little way from thence two other Diſciples, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Mar. 1.16, 19. And thereupon as he himſelf is called a <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean,</hi> Matt. 26.69. ſo are his Diſciples called <hi>Galileans,</hi> Act. 1.11.2.7. The firſt miracle he wrought was in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> Joh. 2.11. He went indeed to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the feaſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. but after that returns to <hi>Galilee,</hi> Joh. 4.3, 43. And there he cures the Noble-man's Son, <hi>v.</hi> 46. And this was the ſecond miracle that he did when he was come <hi>out of Judoea into Galilee,</hi> v. 54. And he promiſes his Diſciples that after his reſurrection, he will go before them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Galilee,</hi> Matt. 26.32. So that though he were at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the feaſts, and died there, yet he was conceived in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> there he <hi>lived,</hi> and <hi>preached,</hi> there he called his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> there he did his <hi>miracles,</hi> there he <hi>appeared</hi> to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65506:61"/>his Diſciples after his reſurrection.</p>
               <p>But it is not fit we ſhould diſmiſs this excellent prophecy, which does not onely foretell the great happineſs of <hi>Galilee</hi> by reaſon of the preſence of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but ſeems very particularly to point out thoſe places in <hi>Galilee</hi> that ſhould be thus dignified and honoured. The Prophet does not onely in general foretell the glory and honour that ſhould be done to <hi>Galilee,</hi> by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral name of <hi>Galilee</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but he is more particular in naming the places of <hi>Galilee,</hi>

                  </note> which ſhould be thus dignified; the <hi>land of Zabulon</hi> which is firſt named (our Saviour having his firſt abode in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that tribe) and the land of <hi>Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thali</hi> (for there our Saviour lived after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> a great City in that tribe) where our Saviour dwelt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he left <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that this prophecy might be fulfilled, ſays St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 4. ver. 13, 14. Now this <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum</hi> was ſituated upon the coaſt of the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> or <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and on the borders of <hi>Zabulon:</hi> and both It and <hi>Nazareth</hi> were beyond <hi>Jordan:</hi> And now this agrees exactly with what the Prophet expreſſes by <hi>Zabulon</hi> and <hi>Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thali,</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:65506:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>the way of the Sea beyond <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> Thus was <hi>Capernaum</hi> exalted unto Heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.15. And this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was fulfilled in our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is foretold of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (Mal. 3.1.) that, after the appearance of his forerunner, he ſhall <hi>ſuddenly come into his temple.</hi> And the appearance of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in that temple was to be the glory of it. <hi>The deſire of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall come, and I will fill this houſe with glory,</hi> Haggai 2.7, 9. It is very evident, as I have proved before, that the glory of the ſecond Houſe above the firſt, which is promiſed by God in this Prophet, can be underſtood of nothing leſs than of the glory which that Houſe ſhould receive from the preſence of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was not onely to come during the ſtanding of that Temple, but was alſo to be preſent in it. I ſhall therefore at this time onely ſhew that this was fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus.</hi> As this was predicted ſo was it underſtood by the Jews: The wiſe and the devout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them waited for the <hi>Meſſias</hi> there. <hi>Simeon</hi> (the Son of <hi>Hillel,</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Gamaliel</hi>) is an inſtance of this. <hi>He came by the ſpirit into the temple</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:65506:62"/>with this expectation, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.27.) And <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſs was another, who <hi>departed not from the Temple,</hi> (ver. 36, 37.) And as this was foretold and expected, ſo it was fulfilled in our <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> He was preſented at the Temple forty days after his birth, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.22.) And from the infancy of <hi>Jeſus</hi> till he was about thirty years old we read no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him, onely this, that at twelve years of age he was found in the <hi>Temple</hi> diſcourſing with the Doctours, (<hi>v.</hi> 46.) and when he was queſtioned for it by his Parents who ſought him ſorrowing, <hi>He ſaid unto them, how is it that ye ſought me, wiſt ye not that I muſt be</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (we render it <hi>about my father's buſineſs,</hi> but it is by the <hi>Syriack</hi> truly rendred) <hi>in my father's houſe? q. d.</hi> Do ye not conſider that according to the predictions of the Prophets I was to have been in the Temple? In the <hi>Temple</hi> we find <hi>Jeſus</hi> driving out the ſellers and money-changers, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 2.14.) He <hi>taught</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and for that end came again into the <hi>Temple,</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 7.14. with chap. 8.2.) In the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he was teaching in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and in the morning all the people came to hear him in the <hi>Temple,</hi> (Luk. 21.37,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65506:63"/>38.) <hi>Jeſus</hi> tells the Jews that he was <hi>daily with them in the Temple,</hi> (Lu. 22.53.) And when the High Prieſt asked him of his Diſciples and Doctrine, he ſaid, <hi>I ever taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple whither the Jews al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way reſort, and in ſecret have I ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> Joh. 18.20.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we have in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeveral characters of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that do exactly agree with our <hi>Jeſus.</hi> We find the <hi>Meſſias</hi> deſcribed of old, as to his temper and the manner of his converſation with men, and we find that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> was ſuch a perſon. There never appeared in the world any perſon to whom thoſe characters did ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly and manifeſtly belong as they did to our bleſſed Saviour. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; whoever remembers the peaceable converſation of our bleſſed Saviour, his great innocence and inoffenſiveneſs, and the great bleſſing which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth upon them that make peace, (<hi>Matt.</hi> 5.9.) will find that he is, as the Prophet calls the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> (Iſa. 9.6.) The great holineſs and righteouſneſs of his life agreed well with the Prophet's character of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65506:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Meſſias; Righteouſneſs ſhall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulneſs the girdle of his reins,</hi> (Iſa. 11.5.) He that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the great calmneſs of our Saviour's temper, and how he avoided popular fame and breath, will apply that to him which is ſaid of the <hi>Meſſias. He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreets,</hi> (Iſa. 42.2. with Matt. 12.18.) When we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the great <hi>meekneſs of Jeſus,</hi> we find it agree with the Prophet's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>lowly,</hi> which he gave of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> (Matt. 11.29. with Zechar. 9.9.) What was there ever ſaid of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> of old which was not fulfilled in our <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?</hi> Well might <hi>Philip</hi> ſay to <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nael,</hi> of <hi>Jeſus, We have found him of whom Moſes in the law, and the Prophets did write,</hi> (Joh. 1.45.)</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It was foretold of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that he ſhould doe many great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works. The works which he ſhould doe are ſet down, and our <hi>Jeſus</hi> did thoſe very works; and this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument that he is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> who was promiſed. Of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> it was foretold that he ſhould <hi>open the blind eyes,</hi> (Iſa. 42.7.) <hi>unſtop</hi> the <hi>ears</hi> of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65506:64"/>the <hi>deaf,</hi> and untie the <hi>tongue of the dumb,</hi> (Iſa. 35.5, 6.) That he ſhould <hi>preach good things unto the meek,</hi>

                     <gap reason="foreign">

LXXII.</note> or, which ſeems to be all one, <hi>preach the Goſpel to the poor, and give liberty to the captives; and reſtore joy to the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, givirg the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heaveneſs; and that he ſhould proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,</hi> (Iſa. 61.2, 3.) Our <hi>Jeſus</hi> did theſe things, and by doing theſe works he made it appear that he was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Son of God: And we find him often referring the <hi>Jews</hi> to the works which he did. When the Jews would know of him whether he were the <hi>Chriſt</hi> or not, he tells them, <hi>The works that I doe in my father's name they bear witneſs of me,</hi> Joh. 10.24, 25. Again, <hi>If I doe not the works of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, believe me not: But if I do, though ye believe not me believe the works,</hi> ver. 37, 38. Again, <hi>Believe me for the very works ſake,</hi> Joh. 14.11. His works pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him to be the <hi>Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> Joh. 3.2.7.31. When <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſent ſome of his Diſciples to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to know whether or not he were the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was to come, we find he returned this anſwer. <hi>Go,</hi> ſays <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65506:64"/>and ſhew John thoſe things which ye do hear and ſee; the blind receive their ſight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed up, and the poor have the goſpel preached unto them,</hi> Matt. 11.4, 5. He did ſuch works as none could doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the divine aſſiſtance, and thoſe very works alſo which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to doe (according to the predictions of him) when he came into the world. But this argument requires a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſideration.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE words which I named before (<hi>Matt.</hi> 11.4, 5.) deſerve a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration, as they do very much confirm the truth which I am now inſiſting upon. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it will be well worth our while to conſider the occaſion of thoſe words as well as the deſign of our Saviour in ſpeaking them at that time.</p>
               <p>We find that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> (the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of our bleſſed Saviour) who was himſelf confined to a priſon, ſent two of his Diſciples, when he heard of the works of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to know whether or not he were the <hi>Meſſias</hi> who was to come, or whether they were to expect ſome other. <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look for another?</hi> v. 3.</p>

He had ſeen the ſpirit deſcend from heaven like a Dove, and abiding on him. He ſaw and bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that he was the Son of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.32,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65506:65"/>34. He baptized <hi>Jeſus</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi> Matt. 3.15. And it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. <hi>that John was not caſt yet into priſon.</hi> And we find him preſently after thoſe words teſtifying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> v. 28. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> knew him well, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he baptized him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. It could be no new thing to hear of the fame of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> he himſelf having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that his fame would ſpread, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.30. He had been queſtioned who he was, and had confeſſed that he was not the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but his forerunner, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.20, 23. And when he ſaw <hi>Jeſus</hi> walking he called him the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> Joh. 1.36. From all which it is abundantly evident that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did not ſend to inform himſelf, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcore, and for the ſake of his Diſciples. His Diſciples wanted confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in that truth which their Maſter was well aſſured of. There was among the Jews a fond expectation that their <hi>Meſſias</hi> would appear like a Temporal Prince,<note place="margin">Act. 1.6.</note> and deliver the Jews from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude and ſlavery; they expected to be great men, and no longer in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to any foreign power.

               <p>Now was <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in Priſon, and would ſhortly be beheaded there.

Hence <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſends his Diſciples when he himſelf was in <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> v. 2. He ſends them when they moſt needed to be confirmed in the faith; for the impriſonment and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing death of their Maſter would be apt to make them queſtion whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> were the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or they not ſtill to look for another.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe to be conſidered that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> lays hold of the fitteſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſending his Diſciples for their greateſt ſatisfaction: His being in <hi>Priſon</hi> implies that they needed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the faith; but then the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the <hi>works,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, ſeems to be the <hi>occaſion</hi> of ſending the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65506:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>Diſciples at a time when they were like to receive the utmoſt ſatisfaction which could be deſired.</p>
               <p>And no leſs ſeems to be implied in the ſecond verſe of this Chapter: <hi>Now when John had heard in the priſon the works of Chriſt he ſent two of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the meſſage he ſent them on, it was of the greateſt moment: <hi>Art thou he which ſhould come, or do we look for another?</hi> v. 3. <hi>i. e.</hi> Art thou the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was promiſed to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, or muſt we expect him to come ſtill?

For he was promiſed long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under this expreſſion of one that ſhould in due time <hi>come</hi> among them. <hi>The Sceptre ſhall not depart from Judah untill Shiloh come,</hi> Gen. 49.10.

And agreeably hereunto the time of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is called the <hi>kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>world to come,</hi> Mark 11.10. Hebr. 2.5. and chap. 6.5. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the great hope and expectation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:65506:67"/>They promiſed themſelves very juſtly glorious things from his manifeſtation. The woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> could ſay, <hi>I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is come, he will tell us all things,</hi> Joh. 4.25.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider the anſwer which <hi>Jeſus</hi> returned unto this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Diſciples: He refers them to his works for ſatisfaction. It was upon the occaſion of the <hi>works</hi> which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did, that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſent his Diſciples, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and when they come we find that <hi>Jeſus</hi> refers them to the <hi>works</hi> which he did. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, go and ſhew John a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain thoſe things which ye do hear and ſee: The blind receive their ſight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, the dead are raiſed up, and the poor have the goſpel preached unto them,</hi> v. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had born witneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> before; he does not ſend them back to their <hi>Maſter,</hi> but refers them to his <hi>works. Ye ſent unto John</hi> (ſays our Saviour to the Jews) <hi>and he bare witneſs unto the truth,</hi> Joh. 5.33. but then our Saviour adds, v. 36. <hi>But</hi> I <hi>have greater witneſs than that of John;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65506:67"/>for the works which the father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me to finiſh, the ſame works that I doe bear witneſs of me that the father hath ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His works then were a good proof that he was, what he profeſſed himſelf to be, the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Son of God. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> could not but confeſs that no man could doe the <hi>miracles</hi> which he did <hi>except God were with him,</hi> Joh. 3.2. And many of the Jews could not but ſay, <hi>When Chriſt cometh will he doe moe miracles than theſe which this man hath done?</hi> Joh. 7.31. The works which he did, ſpake who he was; for ſuch they were as did plainly proclaim a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power.</p>
               <p>But beſides; the works which our Saviour did, and to which he refers the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> were thoſe very works which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to doe according to the prediction of the Prophet: And theſe works here mentioned are thoſe very works: When our Saviour tells them that the <hi>blind receive their ſight, the lame walk;</hi> it is no more but what the Prophet had foretold ſhould come to paſs in the days of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> Iſa. 35.5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:65506:68"/>It may indeed be asked why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhould uſe theſe words, <hi>and the poor have the goſpel preached unto them:</hi> For why ſhould this be reckoned as a miracle, or where was this foretold of the <hi>Meſſias?</hi> But the anſwer is very eaſie to this. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, this was foretold of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that he ſhould <hi>preach the goſpel to the poor:</hi> For <hi>preaching good tidings to the meek,</hi> Iſa. 61.1. is the ſame thing with <hi>pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ching the goſpel to the poor.</hi> And the ſame words are uſed by the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint in the Prophet which are uſed by the Evangeliſt here.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that though <hi>preaching the goſpel to the poor</hi> be not a miracle (nor is it reckoned ſo here) yet it is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that is very remarkable, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pertinent to our Saviour's purpoſe. We muſt know that poverty was very much contemned by the Jews: Poor men were eſteemed evil alſo. And they have a ſaying among them, that <hi>the ſpirit of God does not reſt upon a poor man.</hi> Hence the poor and common people were ſlighted, and reckoned as children of the Earth: Their Prophets of old were generally ſent to Kings, their Scribes and Doctours taught the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65506:68"/>rich. They expected a Princely <hi>Meſſias</hi> that would Lord it over poor men. But our Saviour puts them in mind here that it was foretold that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould preach to the <hi>meek</hi> or <hi>poor.</hi> And that when he did ſo (as we know he did to poor Fiſhermen and Publicans) they ought to conſider that he did that which was predicted of the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For that thoſe words (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1.) belong to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> our Saviour elſewhere gives the Jews to underſtand, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18, 21.) Nor do we find that they had any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with him about that matter: No; they were ſo far from it that we are told they <hi>all bare him witneſs, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the gracious words which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of his mouth,</hi> (V. 22.)</p>
               <p>Nor could any thing have been ſaid more ſeaſonably to the Diſciples of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> than this (after our Lord had referred them to the works which he did) that he <hi>preached the Goſpel to the poor;</hi> becauſe this would ſet them right as to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom they were to receive. For they may not now look for a temporal Prince to conquer and captivate their powerfull enemies, but a meek, and lowly, and mercifull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that would converſe with, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65506:69"/>the poor and the needy. So that thoſe words, <hi>and the poor have the Goſpel preached,</hi> &amp;c. tend to inſtruct them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom they were to expect, and the nature of his Kingdom: For had he been ſuch a temporal Prince, as the Jews were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to expect, he would rather have employed his arms againſt the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies of his people, than to take upon himſelf the care of preaching the Goſpel, and that not to the <hi>wealthy</hi> and <hi>honourable,</hi> but to the <hi>poor</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>But not to inſiſt any longer upon this matter; I ſhall onely conſider that our Saviour refers the Diſciples of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to the works which he did as a proof that he was the <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was to come into the world. So then the works, which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did, are a good proof that he was the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and do very much confirm the Doctrine which he taught. This was the great end for which they were done, and for which they are recorded alſo. <hi>Theſe are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ye might have life through his name,</hi> (Joh. 20.31.)</p>
               <p>By the works of <hi>Jeſus</hi> muſt be meant
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65506:69"/>the miracles which he wrought, and to which he appeals upon all occaſions, as well as in theſe words of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> Theſe miracles are a good argument of the truth of what <hi>Jeſus</hi> profeſſed, and of what he taught. And I ſhall make this appear to thoſe who are unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the ſincere enquirers after truth.</p>
               <p>This is a truth of great moment, and that which tends very much to beget faith in us, and to diſpoſe us to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the truth. Theſe miracles that were wrought do not onely ſpeak the <hi>truth</hi> of our Saviour's doctrine, but the <hi>great moment</hi> of it alſo: And ſo they do tend toward not onely the begetting in us a <hi>belief</hi> but a great <hi>veneration</hi> alſo of theſe divine truths. And he that goes about to deny, or to diſparage our Saviour's miracles, does at the ſame time endeavour to overthrow a main ground of Chriſtian Religion, and one great motive of its credibility.</p>
               <p>I ſhall the rather enlarge upon this argument, both becauſe of its great weight and uſefulneſs, and alſo becauſe there have not been wanting in all ages thoſe who have denied or diſparaged the miracles which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did; and by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65506:70"/>ſo doing have hindred, what in them lay, the propagation of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>In our Saviour's time we find thoſe that endeavoured to overthrow the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of our Saviour's miracles. When <hi>Jeſus</hi> had reſtored one that was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a Devil, and who was blind and dumb, inſomuch that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were amazed, and ſaid, <hi>Is not this the Son of David?</hi> There wanted not then among the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who durſt affirm <hi>that he caſt out Devils by Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub the Prince of Devils.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 12.22.</note> Our Saviour does indeed ſufficiently refute this ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and ſhews the inconſiſtency thereof; and does lay before us the greatneſs of the ſin of theſe men who imputed a work of the Holy Ghoſt to the Prince of Devils: And aſſures us that whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">v. 32.</note> it <hi>ſhall not be forgiven him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi> Theſe evil men were not able to deny the matter of fact, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that the blind ſaw, and the dumb ſpake: But then they were guilty of ſpeaking againſt the Holy Ghoſt when they imputed this work of his to the power of the Devil.</p>

                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:65506:70"/>The <hi>Jews</hi> in after-times could not deny that <hi>Jeſus</hi> had done great works among their Forefathers; but then theſe wretched men run into fables, and make lies their refuge, and give ſuch an account of the whole matter as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries its confutation along with it; the account which they give is this.</p>

                  </note> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth <hi>came to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and that in the Temple he found a ſtone (on which the Ark of God was wont to reſt) whereon was written the</hi> Tetragramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>or,</hi> more peculiar name of God. <hi>That whoſoever ſhould get that name into his poſſeſſion, and be skilled in it, would be able to doe what he pleaſed. That their Wiſe-men fearing leſt any of the</hi> iſraelitese <hi>ſhould get that name, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the world, made two Dogs of braſs, and placed them at the door of the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary: That whenever any had gone in and learnt that name, theſe Dogs were wont at their coming out to bark ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly that they forgat the name, and the letters which they had newly learnt. But</hi> (ſay they) Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth <hi>went in and did not onely learn the letters of this name, but wrote them in a Parchment, which he hid as be came out in an inciſion
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65506:71"/>which he had made in his fleſh. And though through the barking of the Dogs he had forgot the name, yet he learnt it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards from his Parchment. By vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this name</hi> (ſay they) Jeſus <hi>reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the lame, healed the leprous, raiſed the dead, walked himſelf upon the Sea.</hi> By this account it appears that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not deny the matter of fact: for that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did the works is confeſſed on all hands, and ſo much we may gain from this fabulous narration: There is nothing elſe in it worthy the notice of a wiſe man.</p>
               <p>But ſtill there is another opinion to be found among the <hi>Jews</hi> of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and it was this; That the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> when he came was not to work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and that therefore the working miracles was not to be any mark and character of the true <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Nor is it ſtrange that when the <hi>Jews</hi> were not able to deny the matter of fact that they ſhould betake themſelves to theſe fond opinions.<note place="margin">Maimon. H. Melac. <hi>&amp;</hi> Milch. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us that we muſt not think that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall work ſigns and miracles, that he ſhall innovate in the things of this world, or raiſe the dead: But that the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſhould endure for ever, and that the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65506:71"/>
                  <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall meditate in that law, and compell the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to obſerve it; and that he ſhall manage the Lord's battels and overcome the people that are round about him. The truth of this doctrine of his ſhall be conſidered in its due place. I onely produce this to ſhew how unwilling the <hi>Jews</hi> are to allow of this argument which we draw from the works which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did, and how unable they are in the mean time to deny the matter of fact.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe fond and evil opinions there is ſtill another advanced by a late Authour, and directly levelled againſt the force of our Saviour's argument; and 'tis this:<note place="margin">Tractat. Theolog. Politic. c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> That nothing happens in nature that is repugnant to its univerſal laws, nor any thing which doth not agree with them, or follow from them: He hath alſo the confidence to affirm, That the name of a miracle can onely be underſtood with reſpect to mens opinions, and that it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a work, the natural cauſe of which we are not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>exemplo alterius rei ſolitae;</hi> or at leaſt he is not able to explain it that writes or reports the miracle. And that therefore a miracle is a mere ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65506:72"/>And that thoſe things which the Scriptures truly report to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened fell out according to the laws of nature; and if any thing elſe evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to the laws of nature be reported, or which cannot follow from them, that it is to be believed that theſe things were added to the Scripture by ſacrilegious men.</p>
               <p>This wicked principle is ſufficiently refuted by our Saviour's words, who makes the works which he did an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the truth of what he ſaid. And ſure if he did no work but what other men did or might doe, and what agreed with the laws of nature, his works would have been a very mean proof of his coming from God. He that believes God to be, cannot think him confined by the laws of nature: However theſe laws conclude the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they do not bind the hands of the great Creatour of the Univerſe. No man can affirm what the above-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Authour does, unleſs he be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, or an Apoſtate. He muſt be a man forſaken by his reaſon that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes at this rate, or given over for his wickedneſs to believe a lie. What do ſuch abhorred principles aim at but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65506:72"/>at the ſubverſion of Chriſtianity? And if they were guilty of the unpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt who affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Saviour's miracles to have been wrought by the power of the Devil, what ſhall we think of them who dare affirm that he wrought none at all?</p>
               <p>Having premiſed theſe things I ſhall now proceed to ſhew that our Saviour's miracles were a good proof of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and that he was the <hi>Meſſias</hi> who was to come into the world. And for my better proceeding,</p>

                  </note> of which no expreſs reaſon can be given. I do not think it worth my while to reckon them up after him. Sure I am we have no reaſon to believe any ſuch thing. And 'tis a vain and fooliſh thing to vaunt of ſo many miracles when there is no appearance of any one: and 'tis a very unreaſonable thing that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould oblige us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a miracle which we are not able to diſcern.</p>
               <p>A miracle which convinceth us of the truth of a Doctrine muſt be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſenſe, it muſt be ſeen or felt, or diſcernible ſome ſuch way: And 'tis a vain thing to call upon us to believe that which is the motive and ground upon which we believe ſomething elſe. I ſhall as ſoon believe a dead man raiſed to life, who yet lies in his grave, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either breath or motion, as much
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65506:75"/>as the earth in which he lies; or that a blind man is perfectly cured, who yet hath recovered no ſight at all, as to believe that to be fleſh and bloud which all my ſenſes tell me are bread and wine. The miracles which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did were wrought <hi>that men might believe</hi> (not the miracles, for them they ſaw, but) <hi>that he was the Chriſt the Son of God.</hi> He requires men to believe him and his doctrine, for the ſake of his works.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have us believe not onely a doctrine, which is not revealed, but a miracle alſo (not to ſay more than one) which is not diſcernible by any of our ſenſes. We muſt believe a miracle though we do not ſee it, and be condemned for <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> if we do it not. Such a <hi>Faith</hi> ſo <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>large</hi> an one does the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> require. A faith which I am ſure we ſhall never attain unto till that time come (which God of his mercy prevent) that we are given up to believe a Lie. In the mean while we have juſt reaſon to believe the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine falſe, when we find the miracle a mere pretence. And 'twill be time enough to believe this doctrine of

               <p>Indeed <hi>Maimonides,</hi> as I intimated before, denies that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to work miracles: But this is not the ſenſe of the Jewiſh Nation, but an opinion that the <hi>Jews</hi> fly to for refuge.

                  <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was the forerunner of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> he was born a little before our Saviour; and he appearing at that time when the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was expected, and being very much famed for his vertue, and followed by the people, they were prone to take him for the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf feared him as one that might eaſily draw away the people, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us.<note place="margin">Antiqu. lib. <hi>18.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Joh. 10.41.</note> that <hi>he did no Miracle.</hi> It was ſo ordered by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſhould want this <hi>Character</hi> of the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> viz. the working of Miracles.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> That Miracles are a good Argument of the truth of a Doctrine. And that therefore our Saviour did with great reaſon refer <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Diſciples to the works which they ſaw.</p>
               <p>This I think my ſelf obliged the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to inſiſt upon, the thing it ſelf being of great moment, and it being oppoſed by the enemies of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maimon</hi> affirms that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not believe <hi>Moſes</hi> becauſe of his Miracles which he did.<note place="margin">Fundam. Leg. c. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> And he hath added that he that believes upon the ſcore of Miracles will be liable to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect inchantment or ſome other fraud. And moreover he adds, that all the <hi>Miracles</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> did in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, he did them upon the account of ſome neceſſity which moved him,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65506:79"/>and not to gain belief to his Prophecy. Thus (ſays he) it was neceſſary in order to the drowning of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> that the Sea ſhould be divided and let looſe upon them. We wanted food (ſays he) and he ſent <hi>Manna:</hi> They were thirſty and he opened a rock: The congregation of <hi>Corah</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him, and therefore the Earth ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them up.</p>
               <p>At this rate does that ſubtile enemy of Chriſtianity diſcourſe: And 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie to obſerve what he drives at in all this. I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to ſhew that other <hi>Jews</hi> have taught a Doctrine contrary to what <hi>Maimon.</hi> teaches. It were no hard matter to ſhew this; but 'tis of little moment to doe that toward my preſent purpoſe. I ſhall doe that which is material to my purpoſe in hand in ſhewing that this Doctrine is in it ſelf falſe.</p>
               <p>When God was about to ſend <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ex. 4.1.</note> we find <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> objected and ſaid, <hi>they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me:</hi> Hereupon God bids him caſt his rod upon the ground, and the rod was turned into a ſerpent. And this that they <hi>may believe that the Lord God of their fathers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 5.</note> &amp;c. <hi>hath appeared
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65506:79"/>unto thee;</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Moſes.</hi> After this the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> was turned le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous, and reſtored again; upon which <hi>Moſes</hi> is told, that if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would not believe him upon the firſt,<note place="margin">v. 8.</note> that they ſhould <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>voice</hi> of the <hi>latter ſign. Moſes</hi> tells <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that at his requeſt the plague of frogs ſhould be removed,<note place="margin">Ex. 8.10.</note> 
                  <hi>that thou mayſt know</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that there is none like unto the Lord our God.</hi> So far it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought ſigns to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure belief.</p>
               <p>But let us follow <hi>Moſes</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and ſee whether it be true which <hi>Maimon.</hi> affirms, that thoſe Miracles were not wrought to gain belief to his Prophecy. I ſhall content my ſelf with one of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which <hi>Maimon.</hi> himſelf mentions, as a work that <hi>Moſes</hi> did to ſerve a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity, and not to gain credit to his Prophecy. And that is the Miracle which was wrought upon occaſion of the rebellion of <hi>Corah,</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Now it is very evident from the Text that that Miracle was wrought to aſſert the Prophecy of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as the right of <hi>Aaron;</hi> as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Corah</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:65506:80"/>and his company:<note place="margin">Numb. 16.5.</note> 
                  <hi>To morrow</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Lord will ſhew who are his, and who is holy; and will cauſe him to come near unto him, even him whom he hath choſen, will he cauſe to come near unto him.</hi> Again, when thoſe evil men were about to be ſwallowed up we find <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaying. <hi>Hereby ye ſhall know that the Lord hath ſent me to doe all theſe works: for I have not done them of mine own mind. If theſe men dye the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon death of all men: or, if they be viſited after the viſitation of all men, then the Lord hath not ſent me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 28, 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>But if the Lord make a new thing, and the Earth open her mouth, and ſwallow them up with all that appertain unto them; and they go down quick into the pit, then ye ſhall underſtand that theſe men have provoked the Lord.</hi> Hence it is evident that the Miracle confirmed the Miſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo had a direct tendence to gain credit and belief unto his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and that a Miracle is a good confirmation of a Doctrine.</p>
               <p>No wonder then that we find our Saviour frequently appealing to his Miracles as the evidences of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: <hi>I have</hi> (ſays he) <hi>greater wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than that of John; for the work

                  <hi>the ſame works that I doe bear witneſs of me that the father hath ſent me.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, we read elſewhere to the ſame purpoſe: <hi>Then came the Jews round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and ſaid unto him, how long doſt thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Chriſt tell us plainly:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it follows preſently. <hi>Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them,</hi>

                  <hi>I told you and ye belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not: The works that I doe in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's name bear witneſs of me.</hi> Again, <hi>Believe me that I am in the father and the father in me; or elſe believe me for the very works ſake.</hi> And in another place our Saviour ſays,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.11.15.24.10.37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had ſin.</hi> Again, <hi>if I doe not the works of my father believe me not: but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, we find that men were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced by the Miracles which <hi>Jeſus</hi> wrought, when he had miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly fed five thouſand men with five loaves and two fiſhes as it is ſaid, <hi>then thoſe men when they had ſeen the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that Jeſus did, ſaid,</hi>

               <p>A Miracle hath always been a good proof of a Doctrine, and ever acknowledged to be very convincing. When <hi>Elijah</hi> had reſtored to life the Widow's Son ſhe concludes him a true Prophet.<note place="margin">1 King. 17.24.</note>

               <p>And as miracles are a good proof of the truth of a Doctrine, ſo our Saviour had great reaſon to reſer the Diſciples of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to his miraculous works; eſpecially when it is conſidered that the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was confirmed by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65506:82"/>and it is very reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the ordinances of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be removed after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they were eſtabliſhed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: And therefore that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould doe greater miracles that <hi>Moſes</hi> ever did.</p>
               <p>Beſides, our Saviour deſigned the deſtruction of the Devil's Kingdom in the world. For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted that he <hi>might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.8.</note> And upon that account it was needfull that he ſhould doe miracles. The Devil had gotten a great and ancient poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over mankind; he had got into the hearts and bodies of men, and dwelt in the Temples of the Heathen world. And whoever conſiders the largeneſs of his dominion, the power and malice of his inſtruments, will eaſily grant that there was need of a mighty power to diſpoſſeſs him. Now our Saviour and his followers made uſe of no carnal weapons, they armed no legions, raiſed no fighting men by ſea or land: And yet it is not to be believed that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil could be driven out of his ancient poſſeſſion and ſtrong holds without a greater power than what he was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65506:83"/>of, and that muſt be a divine power. The power of the Devil was great at our Saviour's appearance. He dwelt in the Heathen Temples, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their Oracles; an idolatrous worſhip obtained in the world; many were there who were poſſeſſed by him. Our Saviour ſtopped his mouth in the Oracles, overthrew his Kingdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the idolatry and ſuperſtition which had overſpread the world, and threw the Devil out of the bodies, and (which was a greater work) out of the hearts of men. The Goſpel ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with great diſadvantages: The preachers of it had not riches, or power, or great birth, or ſtrong alliances, or wordly wiſedom to recommend them: On the other hand they were poor men and deſpiſed: But yet they were endued with power from above of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king miracles, and diſpoſſeſſing the Devil where ever they came.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 276.</note>

                  <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> tells us that there were three pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which did oblige the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they came into the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſet over them a King, to deſtroy the <hi>Amalekites</hi> and to build a Sanctuary or Temple.

                  </gap> in order to obey the law, but becauſe they were weary of <hi>Samuel</hi> a good Governour. And ſo in the caſe before us: The <hi>Jews</hi> require a ſign, and it is not to be ſuppoſed that our Saviour was upon that account diſpleaſed with them. For their law being confirmed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65506:84"/>by Signs and Miracles it was very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for them to require ſigns before they conſented to relinquiſh it. But that was not their fault that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a ſign. But they came to our Saviour <hi>tempting</hi> rather than as <hi>ſincere learners,</hi>

                  <hi>This is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> 'Twas their great Duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Son of God: The <hi>Jews</hi> do not ſtop here, but proceed and demand of him a <hi>ſign: What ſign ſheweſt thou then</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>that we may ſee, and believe thee? what doſt thou work?</hi> This was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable all this while; their fault was that they would chuſe what kind of Miracles our Saviour ſhould work, and they muſt be ſigns from Heaven, and no leſs ſeems to be intimated in the following words. <hi>Our fathers did eat Manna in the deſart: As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, He gave them bread from Heaven to eat.</hi> They muſt have Miracles of this ſort; they are for juſt ſuch ſigns
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65506:84"/>as <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought. There was thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightning, and a thick cloud at the giving the Law upon Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai.</hi> They had <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven in the wilderneſs: They muſt have ſuch ſigns as they pitch upon themſelves, and thus they tempt God by indulging their Curioſity. Our Saviour wrought many ſigns and wonders and did mightily outdoe <hi>Moſes</hi> (as ſhall be ſhewed afterward) and all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: And therefore our Saviour did enough to confirm his doctrine and left the <hi>Jews</hi> without excuſe.</p>
               <p>Miracles are then a good teſtimony provided we are ſure that they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ſtrictly ſo called. For it hath often happened that the World hath been cheated with lying wonders. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians and Impoſtours have impoſed upon men: And it is a matter of ſome difficulty to diſcern the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a true miracle and a falſe one, between that which is indeed the finger of God, and that which is the fraud and artifice of the Devil. If <hi>Moſes</hi> turn a rod into a Serpent, ſo do the Sorcerers alſo; and it might perhaps have puzled the wiſeſt ſtander-by to diſcern the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them. It will be very
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65506:85"/>hard many times <hi>ex parte rei</hi> to Judge what miracles are true and what are falſly ſo called; But though there be a difficulty in judging <hi>ex parte rei,</hi> yet it is poſſible to diſcern true miracles from lying wonders. Elſe our Saviour's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles had been in vain, and could not have been brought as a proof that he was the <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Son of God. We may in this weighty matter be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from miſtake if we conſider it with that due application which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us. I ſhall therefore now prove</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> That our Saviour's were true and unexceptionable miracles. My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is that they were a good proof of his doctrine, and that he was what he profeſſed himſelf to be, the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Son of God. And for the farther proof of this I ſhall offer the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to be conſidered not onely ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately but in conjunction with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Authour of theſe miracles was <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a perſon of a moſt innocent and uſefull life. Had he been a profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate perſon, or had he been ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected of an untruth, the miracles which he did would not have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65506:85"/>to gain him credit. He was far removed from oſtentation and vain glory, a great example of meekneſs and humility, of purity and peaceableneſs, of an ardent love to God and contempt of the World. Nothing but impudent malice could accuſe our Lord. He did good to all, and did not hurt the pooreſt and vileſt man in the world. He did not come to deſtroy but to ſave the lives of men. He gained no wealth by his works, who had not where to lay his head. He deſired no applauſe, for he charges thoſe that ſaw his works that they ſhould tell no man. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects no Dominion, and did not make his power of doing theſe works a ſtep to worldly greatneſs: Indeed he bids <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> Diſciples ſhew <hi>John</hi> the things which they ſaw and heard, but this was an effect of his Charity to them or to their Maſter, and not becauſe he affected popular fame. He was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent a perſon that the very Judge who delivered him to death did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him innocent, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him was overtaken with that horror that he went and hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: He was judged a righteous perſon by ſtrangers, and his enemies were
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65506:86"/>forced to make uſe of falſe and incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent witneſſes, of loud clamours and the ſpecious pretence of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to procure his death. He ſpent his time in doing good, and was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt example that ever appeared in the world of the moſt ſpotleſs purity, the profoundeſt humility and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and univerſal charity. The miracles of ſuch a Perſon are of mighty force: For if an holy and good life do very much commend a Doctrine, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch a life as our Saviour's was, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the mighty works which he did, is of great moment to aſſure us of the truth of what he taught.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I conſider next the doctrine which the works that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did do confirm: This doctrine was like <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf, holy, juſt and good: It is the wiſeſt and the beſt Religion in the world, and that which tends to make men good and happy: It does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a number of ceremonies and ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, a few ſmall and trifling opinions; it is not a doctrine which promotes a ſecular and worldly intereſt, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges men in their luſts and onely robs them of their wealth: It is a doctrine that is holy and innocent, that teaches
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65506:86"/>us to love God with our whole heart, and our neighbour as our Selves. It permits us not to doe any evil, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to doe all the good we can: It is ſo far from allowing us to <hi>doe</hi> an injury, that it will not ſuffer us to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> it: It teaches us to be humble and modeſt, chaſt and temperate, very frequent and very fervent in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, ſincere in all our promiſes and profeſſions, and very bountifull in our mercy which we ſhew to the poor and miſerable: A Religion that requires the Service of the heart, that lays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the beſt precepts, and propounds the moſt incomparable rewards. It abſtracts us from the world, and puts us upon purſuance of life and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. It does not onely forbid Adultery, Murther and Theft, but every impure thought, every angry word, every covetous deſire: It comports with our wiſeſt faculties, quiets our minds, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects our natures, kills our luſts, and joys our hearts. It bids us doe as we would be done by, obey our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, be gentle to our Servants, kind to the poor, juſt to all men. It allows us not to think any evil, and does ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require that we ſpeak evil of no man.

It is the beſt ſecurity and the greateſt bleſſing to Kingdoms and Commonwealths, and all ſocieties of men. It diſowns every thing that is unjuſt and untrue, that is ſneaking and unbecoming, that is low and mean. It deſigns to conform us to the likeneſs of God: And whoever looks into its laws may ſoon diſcern that it is a bleſſed inſtitution, and not a ſyſteme of craft and worldly policy to keep the world in awe withall. It is full of weighty principles, of divine and heavenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, of the moſt endearing and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick motives to obedience.

               <p>When I ſpeak thus of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion I ſpeak of it as it is in its ſelf, and to them who give up themſelves to the obedience of it: Chriſtianity, I know, is depraved and greatly corrupted by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and there are but few of thoſe who underſtand their Religion better that have any more than a form of godlineſs, when they continue enemies to the power of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I conſider in the next place the great deſign of the miracles which <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> did.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65506:92"/>the uncertain winds and the raging Sea. He reſtores to health, and raiſes to life with a word of his mouth or a touch of his garment. The dead hear his voice, and he does theſe mighty works with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay and without labour. He did not doe as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did, (2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.33.)</p>
               <p n="2">[2.] His works were <hi>various</hi> and of <hi>ſeveral kinds:</hi> He might have been preſumed to have had ſome particular skill or gift had he onely cured one diſeaſe: But here's no room left now for ſuſpicion:<note place="margin">Matt. 4.23, 24. ch. 9.35.</note> For he healed all ſorts of diſeaſes; reſtored the blind, cleanſed the lepers, governed the ſea and winds, and makes the grave give back its dead. All this could not be imputed to any particular gift or skill:<note place="margin">Joh. 9.32.</note> It was never heard that any man (let him be never ſo great an Oculiſt) opened the eyes of one that was born blind. It muſt be granted that here was the hand of God.</p>
               <p n="3">[3.] Theſe were works of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>kindneſs</hi> alſo,<note place="margin">Plin.</note> which ſpeaks them to be from God. The Heathen could ſay, <hi>Deus eſt mortali juvare mortalem:</hi> To doe good ſpeaks a divine principle and likeneſs. The <hi>Jews</hi> had no cauſe to ſuſpect that our Saviour was aſſiſted by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65506:92"/>the Devil the enemy of mankind: He might have confirmed his Doctrine by terrible miracles, he chuſes to doe it by great acts of mercy and relief. He might have ſhaken the pillars of the earth, caſt a veil upon the luminaries above, and confirmed his Doctrine by thunder and lightning, by tempeſt and thick darkneſs, and other terrible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his power and diſpleaſure: But our Lord delighted in mercy, and his miracles were ſo many acts of mercy and relief. He confirms his words and relieves the afflicted at the ſame time, and makes joy and gladneſs where-ever he comes. He cleanſeth the lepers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores the blind and lame, and raiſes the dead while the poor have the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached unto them. What great joy muſt this make where-ever he comes to them who were ſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and diſpoſſeſſed; how much joy muſt this needs bring to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons relieved, and to all their friends and relatives! He exerts his power to relieve, not to grieve or afflict man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>His miracles were ſo many proofs of his mercy as well as of his power. It was an argument of <hi>power</hi> to diſpoſſeſs
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65506:93"/>a <hi>Demoniack,</hi> but to the poſſeſſed it was a great act of <hi>compaſſion.</hi> 'Twas a great <hi>power</hi> that multiplied the <hi>loaves</hi> and <hi>fiſhes,</hi> but it was <hi>bounty</hi> too to doe it for the <hi>hungry</hi> multitude. There is required an infinite power to raiſe a dead man, but 'twas a great act of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion alſo to raiſe the onely Son of the widow of <hi>Naim.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 7.</note> His <hi>turning water into wine</hi> was an act of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>relief:</hi> It was a poor wedding (we ſuppoſe) where the proviſion was ſpent while the gueſts remain, and in ſuch caſes men are generally aſhamed that they are not able to entertain their friends. He <hi>manifeſted his glory</hi> when he did it, and his <hi>kindneſs</hi> alſo. It is a God-like thing to be great and good, to uſe power, as our Lord did his, to the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue and relief of the poor and of the miſerable. Our Lord went about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good: 'Tis the Devil, the great enemy of mankind who goes about ſeeking whom he may devour. Our Lord's very miracles were acts of great mercy and relief.</p>
               <p>It is true our Lord curſed the Fig-tree and deſtroyed the herd of Swine:<note place="margin">Vid. Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> Myſtery of Godlineſs. Book <hi>4.</hi> chap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> But then it is to be conſidered that the Fig-tree was barren (to ſay nothing of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65506:93"/>the aenigmatical meaning of that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage) and the Swine which were drowned were unclean by the law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Beſides in both he confirmed his Doctrine, and gave great aſſurance of his power. And it appeared in the caſe of the <hi>Swine,</hi> that the <hi>Devils</hi> had no power to hurt thoſe creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave.</p>
               <p n="4">[4.] Our Lord's miracles were done <hi>publickly</hi> and not in a <hi>corner.</hi>

And when the <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>dumb</hi> was healed <hi>all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> were amazed. When the Widow's Son of <hi>Naim</hi> was reſtored to life, <hi>there was much people</hi> with <hi>Jeſus:</hi> When the man was cured that had been 38 years under his affliction, 'twas done in the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and at a <hi>feſtival</hi> when all the tribes were there. The <hi>Demoniack</hi> was diſpoſſeſſed in a <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,</hi> and when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raiſed <hi>many of the Jews</hi> were by.</p>
               <p>Our Lord uſed no Arts to deceive the people: He does his works in an open and <hi>clear light.</hi> And when it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that he did them more privately he forbids the divulging what he had
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65506:94"/>done, that there might be no ſhadow of any artifice or ſecret contrivance. For our Lord did all things with a great <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ; and though he deſired not the praiſe of his works, yet he did them at leaſt ſo openly that there could be no ſuſpicion of fraud and impoſture.</p>
               <p>This was an argument of our Lord's ſincerity. He wrought miracles that men might believe, and therefore he did that which did moſt of all tend to beget this belief in them. For Miracles are for the ſake of unbelievers, and therefore had need be wrought, and that openly alſo among them.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Moſes wrought</hi> his miracles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the unbelieving <hi>Egyptians:</hi> The <hi>Prophet</hi> goes to <hi>Bethel</hi> and ſhews his ſign in the ſight of <hi>Jeroboam: Elijah</hi> works a miracle in the ſight of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Baal,</hi> and our Lord does his before the <hi>multitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> talks much of miracles wrought within the verge of her own Communion: She maintains doctrines that need confirmation; And if ſhe work miracles ſhe ſhould ſend ſome of her Children hither to work them among us that we might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, or left without a plea. They
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65506:94"/>of her own Communion who believe her doctrines do not need her miracles: If there be any need of them at all it is among us who cannot believe her Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents till we ſee them better confirmed than yet they are. It is to be ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that they want that power which they are not able to make appear. For it is but reaſonable they ſhould be done where there is need of them.</p>

                  <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
                  <p>The Miracles which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did compared with thoſe which were really wrought by the hands of <hi>Moſes;</hi> with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ones of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and with thoſe ſtoried of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> and ſome other Heathens: Of the ſufficient aſſurance which we have that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did thoſe works which are reported of him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore I proceed to conſider what may be objected againſt what hath been ſaid before; I ſhall for the farther confirmation thereof, ſhew that the works which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did, were greater works than ever were done by any other perſon whatſoever. And to that purpoſe I ſhall compare our Saviour's Miracles with thoſe true and divine Miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought; with the pretended Miracles of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and thoſe which are ſtoried in the writings of the Heathens, and more eſpecially ſuch
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65506:96"/>as are told of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I ſhall conſider the Miracles which were wrought by the hands of <hi>Moſes. There aroſe not a Prophet ſince in Iſrael like unto Moſes whom the Lord knew face to face.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 34.10, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>In all the ſigns and the wonders which the Lord ſent him to doe in the Land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his Servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand and in all that great terrour which Moſes ſhewed in the ſight of all Iſrael.</hi> Upon the account of the Miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> did he was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily famed among the Heathens as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his own Countrey men the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> magnifie <hi>Moſes</hi> above the reſt of their Prophets;<note place="margin">Menaſſeh B.

                  </note> And one of their late Writers ſumms up the Miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>other Prophets</hi> from the beginning to the deſtruction of their firſt Temple; and does affirm that the Miracles wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or upon his account, exceed the number of thoſe which were wrought by all the Prophets together. For whereas as all the Prophets for the ſpace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three thouſand years wrought but 74 Miracles, the Miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone were 76. I ſhall not examine his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65506:96"/>account (let it be as it will) but I ſhall ſhew that his works are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with thoſe which our <hi>Jeſus</hi> did.</p>
               <p>I ſhall eſpecially conſider the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which were wrought in <hi>Egypt;</hi> theſe miracles which were then done in order to the bringing out the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> from the bondage in which they were.</p>
               <p>And I muſt needs confeſs they were mighty works, and ſuch as did plainly ſpeak a ſupernatural and Divine power. And I ought not by any means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage thoſe mighty works. I ſhall before I proceed any farther ſhew you, that thoſe miracles were ſuch as did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed give ſufficient credit to the miſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and abundantly confirm the truth of his words. And that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we conſider ſeriouſly theſe three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, the plagues themſelves which were miraculouſly inflicted. Theſe were ſuch works as were above the power of any Creature. The works themſelves declare a divine power. It is true they were not all alike, and the <hi>Magicians</hi> did the ſame works which <hi>Moſes</hi> did for a while.<note place="margin">Exod. 7.12, 22. <hi>ch.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 7.</note> They turned their <hi>rods</hi> into <hi>Serpents,</hi> and <hi>water</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <hi>bloud,</hi> and brought <hi>frogs</hi> upon the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> as well as <hi>Moſes:</hi> Theſe <hi>Magicians</hi> went as far as they could. And it amounts to no more than this, that they were able to <hi>inflict</hi> ſome evils up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Countrey, but not able to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi> them. For though it be ſaid that the <hi>Magicians</hi> brought the Frogs upon the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet it is alſo ſaid that when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would have them <hi>taken away</hi> he applied himſelf to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 8.7, 8.</note> which he would never have done if the <hi>Magicians</hi> could have done it for him: nay, more than this, theſe <hi>Magicians</hi> were out-done by <hi>Moſes</hi> after this. They attempted to follow him but could not doe it; they were not able to bring forth <hi>lice</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did: <hi>Then the Magicians ſaid unto Pharaoh,</hi>

                     <hi>this is the ſinger of God.</hi> They were forced to confeſs a divine power.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, the difference between the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> during theſe <hi>Plagues.</hi> This was indeed very miraculous, and an evident proof not onely of the <hi>divine power,</hi> but alſo of God's more ſpecial care of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> his people, whom he ſent <hi>Moſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> to bring out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And we have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable inſtances to this purpoſe,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65506:97"/>
                     <hi>viz,</hi> that of the <hi>ſwarms of flies,</hi>

                        <hi>ch.</hi> 8.22.</note> Theſe things could not be ſuppoſed caſually to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, but were a great proof of God's providence and care as well as of his being and his power.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, I conſider after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner theſe Plagues were removed. For the very <hi>removal</hi> as well as the <hi>inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſpeaks a divine hand in all this. We do not find the <hi>Magicians</hi> able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, however they were ſuffered to <hi>inflict</hi> a <hi>Plague.</hi> But <hi>Moſes</hi> does not onely <hi>remove</hi> the <hi>Plague,</hi> but (which is well worthy our obſervation) does it <hi>at the time appointed.</hi> Thus in the caſe of the <hi>Frogs,</hi> he leaves in to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> to ſet the preciſe time when the Frogs ſhall be removed; and removes
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65506:98"/>them accordingly,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.9, 10, 29.</note> that <hi>thou mayſt know</hi> (ſays <hi>Moſes</hi> unto him) <hi>that there is none like unto the Lord our God.</hi> The ſame may be obſerved of the <hi>ſwarm of flies,</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe things put together do ſpeak the hand of God in the mighty works which were wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and were ſufficient <hi>proofs</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent by God, and were enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince at once both the <hi>Egyptians</hi> as well as the Sons of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But whatever theſe works of <hi>Moſes</hi> were yet they came far ſhort of the works which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to ſay that the works of <hi>Jeſus</hi> were more in number than thoſe of <hi>Moſes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 20.30. <hi>with ch.</hi> 21.25.</note> when it is apparent that in that reſpect they were more than thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the other Prophets beſide.

                  <hi>If I had not done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the works which none other

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65506:101"/>which they tell, of men who carried their heads in their hands after they had been Beheaded, for ſeveral miles together; of others who ſpake after they were dead; of Sheep and Aſſes running to hear St. <hi>Francis</hi> preach, and of Swine falling dead under his curſe: Of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick</hi> who hung in the air like a <hi>bird,</hi> and at his Devotions forcing the Devil to hold a light and burn his fingers at that ſervice; of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted her ſelf at prayer into a round form like that of an Hedgehog, and who could climb the higheſt trees like a <hi>Squirrel,</hi> and <hi>ſwim</hi> in <hi>rivers</hi> like a Fiſh: Of <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Sienna</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a new heart, and thereupon <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to her, opened her Breaſt, took out her heart, goes away with it and brings another, and tells her that was his own: I will not entertain you with the <hi>Stories</hi> of the <hi>ſweating,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> of their <hi>Images;</hi> of the great feats which have been done by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>holy water</hi> and ſuch like things: Such <hi>Pranks</hi> as theſe are reported which look more like the feats of <hi>Demons,</hi> of <hi>Hob-goblins</hi> and <hi>Fairies</hi> than the <hi>finger</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> The works of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpake the great <hi>wiſedom,

Theſe things can ſerve no good and wiſe purpoſe, and that is not all, for they ſerve a very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil one. Theſe falſe <hi>ſtories</hi> are a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to men to queſtion the true: Men will be too ready to ſuſpect the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when they find themſelves impoſed upon by thoſe who profeſs themſelves his followers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The miracles which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did were to confirm the truth of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian doctrine: But theſe pretended mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are brought to confirm a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taught; <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> taught all Chriſtian doctrine, and all the neceſſary matters of faith. And now though an Angel from Heaven ſhould Preach any other Goſpel, we ought not to receive him, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9.) Were the works of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> like our Saviour's works, and their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine the ſame with his, theſe works would be of great uſe to convince unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65506:102"/>but not at all requiſite where the doctrine was believed before. For the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is the ſame with that of the holy Scriptures, or it is not. If it be the ſame there is no need of miracles (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally among them who believe the holy Scriptures) to confirm that which hath been ſufficiently confirmed already: But if it be not the ſame we are not to regard miracles in that Caſe. Nay if an Apoſtle or Angel from Heaven ſhould Preach another Goſpel, let him be accurſed.</p>
               <p>We ſhall find that the pretended mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the confirmation of the <hi>Novel</hi> doctrines of that <hi>Church,</hi> not of the Chriſtian doctrine taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> We are told that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake intelligibly ſeveral times out of the Wafer to a <hi>Spaniſh Franciſcan:</hi> Again, that upon the Altar he turned himſelf from the form of a Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wafer, into that of a little Child; and then from that of a Child, to that of a Wafer: Again, that a Woman's Bees not thriving, ſhe ſtole a Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wafer and put it into one of her Hives: The devout Bees in honour to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65506:103"/>that, fall to work, and with their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-combs make a little Church, with windows, with roof and door, with belfry and Altar, upon which they laid the Hoſt, and did fly about it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, praiſing the Lord: All this is for the confirmation of the doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> a doctrine which <hi>Chriſt</hi> never taught, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts our ſenſe and our reaſon at the ſame time. And the ſtories which they tell of the <hi>ſweating</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> of their <hi>Images,</hi> ſerve to advance the worſhipping of <hi>Images:</hi> In a word, their works are trifling and vain, and their doctrine is impious and falſe, and, to ſay the leaſt of it, not revealed by God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The miracles which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did were <hi>ſeaſonable,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> at that time to confirm his doctrine; whether we conſider the <hi>obſtinacy</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Upon both accounts it was needfull that the Chriſtian doctrine ſhould be confirmed with miracles, and ſo it was: But the <hi>Popiſh</hi> miracles are out of time; there is no need of them to confirm the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian doctrine where it is already plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Miracles are for the ſake of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and as the world grew Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65506:103"/>they ceaſed; nor is it to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that God will work them without any cauſe at all.</p>
               <p>In the old Teſtament we ſhall find that the greateſt number of miracles were wrought by <hi>Moſes</hi> their Law-giver in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the wilderneſs, before and upon the giving the Law; no man wrought ſo many miracles, nay not all the ſucceeding Prophets together, as he wrought. Thus was the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: And when this was done, you rarely read of miracles wrought after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; when the <hi>Jews</hi> had received and continued in the profeſſion of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The greateſt number that were wrought afterward was, when there was the greateſt reaſon for them; and that was after <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the worſhip of God, and ſet up his Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and no leſs than ten Tribes revolted with him. Then indeed there were ſome number of miracles wrought to convince them of their ſin, and reduce them from their Schiſm: Then was the Altar at <hi>Bethel</hi> cleft in pieces; <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s hand withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and reſtored as miraculouſly upon the prayer of the Man of God. And theſe miracles were wrought in <hi>Bethel,</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:65506:104"/>among the Schiſmaticks, which were to be convinced and reduced. Then <hi>Elijah</hi> ſhut up the Heavens; is mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly fed by the Ravens; multiplies the meal, and raiſes to life the Widow's Son; he calls for fire from Heaven, and faſts forty days; and deſtroys the Captains and their fifties by fire which he called from Heaven; He divides <hi>Jordan</hi> with his Garment, and is mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly taken up into Heaven: And <hi>Eliſhah,</hi> during this time, did many wonderfull works alſo: He divides the river, heals the water, encreaſes the Widow's oil; foretells that the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namite</hi> ſhould have a Child, and raiſed it from the dead. He removes the <hi>death</hi> that was in the <hi>pot,</hi> miraculouſly feeds the people, heals <hi>Naaman</hi> of his Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; He cauſeth <hi>Iron</hi> to <hi>ſwim,</hi> ſtrikes <hi>Gehazi</hi> with a <hi>leproſie,</hi> and the enemies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with blindneſs; and his dry bones, after all theſe things which he did in his life, reſtored one that was dead to life again. Thus in a little time many miracles were wrought more than had been wrought before and after for ſome hundreds of years. So that the great number of miracles were wrought upon the giving the Law, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65506:104"/>upon the greateſt defection from it, and that to confirm the truth and convince gain-ſayers.</p>
               <p>But what means the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to boaſt of miracles? If they be wrought in her own Communion they ſerve no purpoſe: There's no need of a miracle where men believe without it. Their miracles are done at a great diſtance from us who are to be convinced; and ſuch they are which we cannot ſee at all, or elſe we may eaſily ſee through them.</p>
               <p>Of one thing we are ſure, <hi>viz.</hi> that their doctrine is falſe, and then we ſhall have no cauſe to be drawn aſide with lying miracles: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had warning in this caſe, and ſo have we Chriſtians alſo, not to believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our rule any pretence whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. —<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. And we are forewarned of falſe people who ſhould pretend to miracles, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.24. 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> I ſhall proceed to conſider the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which are ſtoried of the Heathens.</p>
               <p>I will not deſcend to all the ſtories that may be found upon record to this purpoſe; becauſe, beſides that we want
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65506:105"/>ſufficient Evidence of the truth of thoſe matters of fact, ſo they are not worthy of conſideration, being things of trifling regard; and ſuch as import no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to mankind.<note place="margin">Origen <hi>contra</hi> Celſ. <hi>l.</hi> 3.</note> Such is that which <hi>Celſus</hi> mentions of <hi>Abaris,</hi> who could fly into the air, and keep pace with an Arrow in that flight.

               <p>For what is ſtoried of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi>'s curing the blind, I ſhall not need to ſay any more than this, That if thoſe reports be true, they are far ſhort of what our Saviour did; nor do
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65506:105"/>we read of any who laid down their lives in teſtimony thereof. And as I do not deny that there have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential miracles out of the Church of God, ſo it is not to be wondred at, that the Devil ſhould exert his utmoſt power to keep men in errour, and, as much as may be, endeavour to imitate God.</p>
               <p>And more particularly ſtill to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is ſtoried of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and of <hi>Adrian,</hi> I ſhall deſire it may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>

It is ſaid that he cured a youth of a <hi>Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;</hi> But is he therefore to be compared with our Saviour, who cured all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and raiſed the dead? Or muſt that be thought a miracle which a wiſe Phyſician may doe? He is ſaid to have done it by precepts of temperance. But as that is a moral inſtrument, ſo 'tis a natural one too. And the practice of that, would go farther towards the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting and curing more diſeaſes, than ever <hi>Apollonius</hi> could pretend unto.</item>
                  <item>3. That in ſome of the pranks which he played, he was guilty of manifeſt impiety: He is ſaid to have cured a man bitten by a mad Dog, by making the Dog lick the man; but then he is ſaid
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65506:107"/>to have cured the Dog alſo, by praying to the river <hi>Cydnus</hi> (an act of Idolatry) and flinging the Dog into the ſtream. He is ſaid to have freed the City of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> from a plague, but to have done it by perſwading the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to ſtone a beggar, and then the <hi>Epheſians</hi> are ſaid to have erected an Image to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules Apotropaeus</hi> in the place where the beggar was ſtoned; ſo that the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> were not brought off from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of falſe Gods by the works of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Beſides it is evident from other paſſages that <hi>Apollonius</hi> was an evil man; a great dictatour and intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler with political affairs, a proud and haughty man: One that vaunted of his great knowledge, and, for all that, was ignorant; He pretended to underſtand all Languages, and to know the thoughts of men,<note place="margin">Euſeb. <hi>contra</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erocl. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>id. l.</hi> 2.</note> and yet could not diſcourſe with King <hi>Phraotes</hi> without an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Having thus far diſcourſed of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did, and ſhewed you how good a proof they are that he was the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I ſhall proceed to conſider</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:65506:107"/>What may be objected againſt what hath been hitherto ſaid: And though there are ſeveral things that might fall under conſideration under this head, yet I know but one thing of any great moment, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> Some man may enquire what ſufficient aſſurance we can have, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did thoſe works which are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him. For though the works reported (all things conſidered) be an unexceptionable Proof of the truth of the Chriſtian doctrine, yet it may ſtill be objected, that we cannot be fully aſſured that <hi>Jeſus</hi> lived and did thoſe things which we read of in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, I deſire the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars may be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is ſufficient that this be proved by ſuch ways and means as the thing is capable of: No man can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably require a ſtrict demonſtration where the matter of the queſtion will not bear it. If we have ſuch a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of moral arguments as will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie a wiſe and inquiſitive man it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. And there are many things which we believe, without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doubt or wavering; to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65506:108"/>of which we are gained this way. We believe thoſe things to be unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably true, which yet we have not ſuch weighty grounds to believe. And it is an argument we are very perverſe if we except againſt thoſe arguments here which we admit every where elſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the matters of fact are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by ſtrangers to, and enemies of the Religion. That there was ſuch a perſon as <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and that he did mighty works; that he was followed by ſuch names as we find in the Goſpels, the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves confeſs. They deny not that he did wonderfull works, they impute them indeed to the Devil, but by doing ſo they do tacitly confeſs that he undoubtedly did them. When <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erocles</hi> compares <hi>Apollonius</hi> with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> he doth not queſtion whether there were ſuch a man or not. The matter of fact was not denyed by <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile:</hi> The firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were not charged with having forged the Hiſtory of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>Of all men in the world, the <hi>Jews</hi> have no reaſon to queſtion the truth of the matter of fact reported in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels: And therefore <hi>Origen</hi> doth deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly reprove <hi>Celſus,</hi> when he feigns a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65506:108"/>
                  <hi>Jew</hi> objecting againſt the credibility of the Goſpel hiſtory: And he tells us what he himſelf, in a diſputation which he had with ſome of the wiſe men of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaid to them upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; his words are theſe. <hi>Tell me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Origen <hi>contra</hi> Celſ. <hi>l.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>ſince there were two perſons who lived in the world, of whom were ſtoried incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, and ſuch as are above humane nature,</hi> viz. Moſes <hi>your Law-giver, who wrote of himſelf; and</hi> Jeſus <hi>our teacher, who wrote nothing of himſelf; but is teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified of by his Diſciples in the Goſpels: what reaſon is there that</hi> Moſes <hi>ſhould be eſteemed worthy of belief, whom the</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians <hi>reproached for a Magician; and that</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſhould not be believed becauſe ye accuſe him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That we have no reaſon at all to ſuſpect thoſe books which give us the hiſtory of theſe things. If we be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuſpect an ancient hiſtory, yet we ought not to do it without juſt cauſe. Either becauſe the Authour is not known, or is of no credit; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it appears that the writing hath been corrupted, or we have ſome collateral evidence which moves us to withhold our aſſent. Nothing of this can be ſaid in the preſent caſe: Theſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65506:109"/>books are not <hi>Anonymous,</hi> and all men are agreed that they were written by thoſe men whoſe names they bear. Theſe men are not to be ſuſpected, for they wrote of things which they ſaw, and of thoſe times in which they lived. It could not be their intereſt to put a cheat upon the world, but againſt all their intereſt in this and the other world too. There is a perfect harmony and agreement among them: and all the marks and tokens of ſincerity that we can deſire.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied indeed that in the writings of theſe men there is ſome variety, and they ſeem not to ſpeak conſiſtently with one another, in ſome of their relations.</p>
               <p>But then they all agree in the main ſtory, and, generally ſpeaking, it is not hard to account for the ſeeming oppoſition in their relations: And it is to be ſuppoſed that our ignorance of the hiſtory, and the phraſeology and uſages of thoſe times and Countries is the true reaſon, why they ſeem to thwart with one another, when really they do not. Beſides it is an argument that theſe men did not combine and lay their heads together to put a trick
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65506:109"/>upon the world. For if they had (which they could have no cauſe to doe) it would have been no hard matter to have avoided not onely contradiction (which they have done) but the very appearance of ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p>Theſe Writers give great proofs of their ſincerity: They give none at all of their oſtentation and vain-glory. <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath well obſerved that S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> diſcovers the baſeneſs of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment before he followed <hi>Chriſt:</hi>

               <p n="4">4. That the Goſpel hath been ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received, is an argument of the truth of it: <hi>A lye hath no feet</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand long without being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Facilè res in ſuam naturam recidunt ubi veritas non ſubeſt.</hi> There were a great many eyes upon <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when it advanced in the world, and it did not want ſubtile and inquiſitive enemies. The fraud would have been detected if there had been any: It was
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65506:110"/>entertained by men of wit and learning, and ſuch as made diligent enquiry after truth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It did not ſpread by <hi>force</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> as the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion hath done; not by <hi>craft</hi> and worldly <hi>policy,</hi> by humane <hi>arts</hi> and <hi>Religious cheats;</hi> but by <hi>ſuffering</hi> and by <hi>tears,</hi> by <hi>hardſhips</hi> and by <hi>ſeverities.</hi> Men were willing to ſhed their bloud in teſtimony of it, and part with all that was dear to fleſh and bloud. All our ancient books tell us, that this was the duty and practice of Chriſtians: men do not uſe to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to loſe their lives, and all the comforts of life to confirm a lie: And we muſt think thoſe men void of all ſenſe, that would dye to confirm a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery and lie, when their death would ſerve to confirm a Religion which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely forbids all Lying and diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And though ſome men may have died in a falſe belief, or a belief of ſome principles which are not really (though to them they ſeem to be) true; yet it is not credible that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men ſhould be content to die in confirmation of a matter of fact, which they knew to be falſe, or did not know to be true. When <hi>Arrius Antoninus</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:65506:110"/>perſecuted the Chriſtians in <hi>Aſia,</hi> they came about his Tribunal and offered themſelves to death, which made him cry out <gap reason="foreign">

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I ſhall ſhew that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed of old was to ſuffer. And this eſpecially againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who do not deny that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſuffered, but do deny him to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Son of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe he ſuffered. This is the ſcandal of the Croſs, at which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumble and fall. Here they are offended, and at a ſtand. Now that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to ſuffer, and <hi>Jeſus</hi> not to be rejected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, will appear if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the following particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I muſt premiſe that it is a very unreaſonable thing, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould be reproached or rejected upon the ſcore of his ſufferings. The <hi>Jews</hi> have no cauſe for this reaſon to ſcorn him, as they commonly do: For his ſufferings do not ſpeaking him an evil perſon, or one unfit to deliver and ſave his followers from the greateſt evils, <hi>viz.</hi> from the power and evil effects of our ſins.</p>
               <p>I grant indeed he was mean and very poor: And what then? Was not the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law-giver <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo alſo? Was he not expoſed to the waters, forced to fly his Country, and tend upon a flock in a foreign Country? Was not <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> tribes, a <hi>poor Syrian</hi> ready to periſh, had he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65506:112"/>any thing more than his ſtaff when he went to <hi>Padan Aram?</hi> Was not <hi>David,</hi> from whom the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to deſcend, a keeper of his Father's Sheep?</p>
               <p>If <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſuffered and were put to death, what then? Have not theſe been the lot and portion of the moſt righteous men in the world? Was not righteous <hi>Abel</hi> killed, when wicked <hi>Cain</hi> lived and built a City? Is it any blot upon the memory of <hi>David</hi> that he was perſecuted; of <hi>Zechariah</hi> that he was ſtoned; of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> that he was ſawn in ſunder? Are the holy men and Prophets of old to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, becauſe they ſuffered reproaches, or were put to death? Why ſhould <hi>Jeſus</hi> then be rejected becauſe he was put to death? This does not ſpeak him an evil man.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> very well know what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays of the ſufferings of God's own people.<note place="margin">Pſal. 79.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>O God the Heathen are come into thine inheritance, thy holy Temple have they defiled, they have laid Jeruſalem on heaps: The dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of thy Servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the Heaven; the fleſh of thy Saints unto the beaſts of the earth: Their bloud have they ſhed like water round about Jeruſalem, and there was none to bury them: We are
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65506:113"/>become a reproach to our neighbours, a ſcorn and deriſion to them that are round about us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were indeed ſevere ſufferings, and upon whom did they light? The Text informs us that they fell upon God's <hi>inheritance</hi> upon his <hi>ſervants,</hi> and <hi>Saints:</hi> And what ever reproach this were to the Heathen who inflicted theſe ſufferings, it is none at all to the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers themſelves.</p>
               <p>In a word, very excellent men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the beſt among the Heathens were poor, and ſuffered the greateſt evils, and no wife man ever thought the worſe of theſe Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; and it is therefore very unjuſt to reject <hi>Jeſus</hi> merely upon that account. I add</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it was foretold by God himſelf, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould ſuffer. I ſhall not give in all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which make for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 53. is moſt clear and remarkable to my preſent purpoſe. In that Chapter the ſufferings or the <hi>Meſſias</hi> are graphically deſcribed: And there never was any people or perſon, to whom all thoſe particulars recited in that Chapter could belong, but to our bleſſed Saviour, who is the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65506:113"/>
                  <hi>Meſſias</hi> there foretold. The <hi>Jews</hi> (I mean the more ancient among them) underſtood that place of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and whereas among the later <hi>Jews</hi> we ſhall find ſome Interpret them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, (whether of the people of <hi>Iſrael, Joſiah,</hi>

                  </note> or ſome other perſon) yet it is manifeſt, and hath been made ſo, that the words muſt be underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and were never fulfilled by any people or any other perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. To whom elſe can thoſe words belong but to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and in whom were they ever fulfilled, but in our <hi>Jeſus</hi> onely, where it is ſaid: <hi>He is deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows and acquainted with griefs.</hi> For never was there a ſorrow like that of our <hi>Jeſus:</hi> Where ſhall we find a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom the following words can belong? <hi>He hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows: He was wounded for our transgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed. All we, like Sheep, have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi> And as theſe ſufferings could be the ſufferings
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65506:114"/>of none but of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> onely, ſo the patient bearing them muſt belong to him too, and was remarkably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in our <hi>Jeſus: He was oppreſſed and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: He is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a Sheep before her Shearers is dumb, ſo he openeth not his mouth.</hi> I may afterward have occaſion to ſhew how remarkably the following words alſo were fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as they were foretold of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> where 'tis ſaid that he <hi>made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> it was intimated that he ſhould ſuffer, it being predicted that the Serpent's ſeed ſhould bruiſe the heel of the ſeed of the Woman.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I might to this purpoſe ſhew at large from the Old Teſtament, that the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> was to ſuffer; Thoſe perſons who were the moſt Eminent <hi>Types</hi> of him, were very great ſufferers: And though all the ſacrifices were ſlain, yet thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which did typifie his death moſt eminently, were moſt intirely conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the fire; and as their bloud was carried into the holy place, ſo their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65506:114"/>body was burnt without the camp, as our Saviour himſelf ſuffered without the gate. If we look into the Pſalms and Prophets, we ſhall find frequent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this is ſo plain a truth,<note place="margin">Abkath Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim. <hi>l.</hi> 1.</note> and ſo undeniable even by the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the later of them have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed a ſuffering <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Ephraim:</hi> And now they ſpeak of a twofold <hi>Meſſias,</hi> one the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to ſuffer death, (if need be) another the Son of <hi>David</hi> to ſave and to deliver them.</p>
               <p>This indeed is a vain conceit, 'tis groundleſs, and 'tis novel: It hath no foundation in the Holy Scriptures, nor in their moſt ancient and genuine Writers.

And though it ſerve to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yet it ſerves to this, that we have gained the point we contend for, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Meſſias</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:65506:115"/>was to ſuffer, and that therefore our <hi>Jeſus</hi> ought not to be rejected upon that account.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> That our <hi>Jeſus</hi> did ſuffer: This is confeſſed on all hands: The <hi>Jews</hi> deny it not, but mention him frequently with ſcorn upon this account.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be very vain if I ſhould be operoſe under this head: He muſt be very ignorant, who hath not heard of the ſufferings of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> His whole life, aſwell as his latter end, was almoſt a perpetual ſuffering. He was <hi>born</hi> in a <hi>ſtable,</hi> and he died upon a <hi>Croſs.</hi> He ſuffered from his firſt entrance into the world, to his going out. The meanneſs of his Birth did not protect him from being perſecuted by <hi>Herod;</hi> He was after this a <hi>man</hi> of <hi>ſorrows</hi> and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with grief, and there hath been no ſorrow like unto his ſorrow. He faſted and was tempted, he was acquainted with hunger and with thirſt, with great poverty and contempt; He met with falſe friends, and implacabe enemies; He was always <hi>doing good,</hi> and <hi>recieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after all at the cloſe of his life, he was a moſt eminent ſufferer: If there
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65506:115"/>be any ſuffering in great pains and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; in being ſcoffed and derided, in being buffeted and ſcourged, in a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſweat, or a bitter cup: In a crown of Thorns, in the Spear and in the Nails: He ſuffered, if to be forſaken and betrayed, to be unpitied in trouble and to be denied; to be flouted and ſcoffed at, be any thing of a ſuffering: He ſuffered, if to die be to ſuffer, and to die upon a Croſs among malefactors. If the <hi>bloud</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> if the <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>curſe</hi> of it, if the <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>ſcandal</hi> of it ſpeak any ſufferings, our Lord did indeed ſuffer.</p>
               <p>From the ſufferings of our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> does appear that he is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not mean that the bare ſufferings of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> are an argument that he is the <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For ſufferings are not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument alone. And though the <hi>Meſſias</hi> were to ſuffer, yet ſo might, and ſo did <hi>Impoſtors</hi> alſo. But as the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to ſuffer, ſo it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted what he ſhould ſuffer; and we ſhall find that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> did ſuffer thoſe very things which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to ſuffer: and all things duely conſidered, we ſhall find this (eſpecially in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65506:116"/>with what hath been and is to be ſaid) a very good proof that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I take to be the meaning of our Saviour's words to his Diſciples go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Emmaus: Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered</hi> Theſe things? And of his words to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> afterward: <hi>Thus it is written, and</hi> Thus <hi>it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer,</hi> Luk. 24.26, 46. St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> that thoſe things which <hi>God before had ſhewed by the mouth of all his Prophets, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer he hath ſo fulfilled,</hi> Act. 3.18. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf ſaid Thus <hi>it muſt be, Mat.</hi> 26.54, 56. To the ſame purpoſe we find the Diſciples ſaying: <hi>For of a truth againſt thy holy Child Jeſus whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod and Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Iſrael were gathered together; for to doe whatſoever thy hand and thy Council determined before to be done.</hi> Act. 4.27, 28.</p>
               <p>We ſhall find afterward, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did ſuffer all that which the <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to ſuffer. And ſome of theſe ſufferings were ſuch as were not likely to have been the portion of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> But ſo it was, though <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:65506:116"/>though the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had an hand in the ſufferings of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they did at the ſame time (though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it not) fulfill ſome Prophecies of old, and this was ſo eminently done, that we have from hence a very great proof that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not look over all the ſufferings of <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the time of his birth, to the moment of his death; I ſhall begin no ſooner than the laſt week of his life; and ſhall more eſpecially conſider thoſe particulars which attended upon his death.</p>
               <p>We have a remarkable Prophecy in the Prophet <hi>Zechariah,</hi> and the words are theſe: <hi>Rejoice greatly O Daughter of Zion; ſhout O Daughter of Jeruſalem: Behold thy King cometh unto thee: He is juſt and having ſalvation, lowly and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon an Aſs, and upon a Colt the foal of an Aſs.</hi> That this place is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> no Chriſtian can doubt, and the <hi>Jew</hi> ought not to deny. <hi>R.

               <p>For it was the ſenſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> that this place was meant of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and we find among the writings, which we have of theirs, plain intimations of it. There is a fabulous relation that the <hi>Aſs</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> ſadled (<hi>Gen.</hi> 22.) was created on the <hi>evening of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pirke R.

From this fabulous relation it is evident that this place was underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bereſith Rabb. <hi>in</hi> Gen. 49.11.</note> To the ſame purpoſe the words are underſtood by another ancient writer who repreſents it as the ſenſe of their Rabbins.</p>
               <p>It was upon the tenth day of the firſt month when our Saviour rode upon an <hi>Aſs</hi> into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and fulfilled this
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65506:117"/>Scripture, and in the <hi>Paſſeover</hi>-week in which he ſuffered, Our Saviour was now ready to be Sacrificed for us, and as the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb in <hi>Egypt</hi> was taken up on the tenth day, ſo did our Lord our <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> on that very day, preſent himſelf in that City, where the ſame week he was ſentenced to death.</p>
               <p>For the reſt of the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, they do very well agree to our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as it is certain they were meant of the <hi>Meſſias. Thy King cometh unto thee, he is juſt and having Salvation, lowly:</hi> Never were there any perſons to whom theſe words could ſo duely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, as our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
               <p>He was a King indeed, and denies it not, before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> though he profeſſed that his <hi>Kingdom</hi> was <hi>not of this world.</hi> As ſuch a perſon the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was promiſed of old, and it was foretold that he ſhould erect an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> expected a temporal Prince indeed, they being themſelves a carnal people: Our Lord did not appear like an earthly Prince, but as one born from Heaven, and that would erect an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and ſpiritual Kingdom in the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65506:118"/>world. A King he was in the beſt and the higheſt ſenſe: and when he was crucified, the main of his accuſation written on his Croſs, was, that he was <hi>King of the</hi> Jews.</p>
               <p>That he was <hi>juſt,</hi> malice it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny of our bleſſed Saviour; He was for giving both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> their due. He paid <hi>Tribute</hi> when it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and would not excuſe himſelf from the publick payment, to which he was not yet ſtrictly obliged. And he took care of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſt-hood alſo: And where he had cleanſed the <hi>Leper,</hi> he takes order that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſhould not loſe the profit, which in ſuch a caſe he was wont to receive. He wronged no man, and though he were poor, yet he took care to give every man his due, and to reſerve ſomething for the poor alſo. His righteouſneſs was ſo exemplary, that the <hi>Jews</hi> who thirſted after his bloud, knew not how to effect his death: They had procured falſe witneſſes indeed, but their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was ſo incoherent, and ſo lewd, that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to uſe another device, (ſince that, frequently made uſe of againſt his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers) <hi>viz.</hi> to repreſent him as an
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65506:118"/>Enemy to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> And now <hi>Pilate,</hi> to approve himſelf to the <hi>Roman</hi> power, delivers up <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be crucified. But ſtill he pronounced him <hi>innocent,</hi> who gave him up to be crucified: He waſhes his hands, and declares himſelf openly in behalf of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What follows does eminently belong to our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as it was ſpoken of the <hi>Meſſias; Having Salvation.</hi> The very name <hi>Jeſus</hi> by which he was commonly known and called, ſpeaks Salvation. And it was given him by the direction of an <hi>Angel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> becauſe he was to <hi>ſave</hi> his people from their ſins. And as he came to <hi>ſave</hi> what was loſt, ſo we ſhall find that he fulfilled that deſign, and anſwered that bleſſed Name by which he was called, he ſaved ſome from hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt, ſome from diſeaſes and poſſeſſions, ſome from ſickneſs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from death, and all that believe on him from Hell and the wrath which is to come.</p>
               <p>For what follows in the Prophet, that he was to be <hi>lowly,</hi> agrees exactly to our <hi>Jeſus:</hi> For whether by <hi>lowly</hi> be meant <hi>poor,</hi> as that Hebrew word uſed in the Prophet ſignifies; or, <hi>meek,</hi> as it is there rendred by the LXXII
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65506:119"/>Interpreters (whoſe rendring St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> alſo follows) It is certain that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> was both <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>meek</hi> in a very eminent degree: So <hi>poor</hi> that he had not what the Foxes did not want, <hi>where to lay his head.</hi> And for his meekneſs and lowlineſs of mind, he was the moſt eminent and unparrelled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that ever was in the world.</p>
               <p>I ſhall proceed now to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the death of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and thoſe particulars which do more immediately relate thereunto.</p>
               <p>And not to inſiſt upon every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular which makes to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſhall take notice</p>
               <p>Firſt, of the kind of his death, and that was the death of the <hi>Croſs.</hi> A death it was that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> one would have thought, ſhould not have died: For beſides that it was the vileſt and moſt ignominious death, a death of ſlaves and the moſt profligate villains: Beſides this, it was not like to be the portion of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> had a figure of this in the Wilderneſs: Our <hi>Jeſus</hi> put them in mind of it in theſe words. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up,</hi> Joh. 3.14.

               <p>And in its firſt inſtitution it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a <hi>ſign</hi> or <hi>ſymbol</hi> of ſome future good: This is very probable from the very words of the Text; <hi>Moſes is</hi> Commanded to make a fiery Serpent and <hi>ſet it upon a pole</hi> (ſo we render it) or ſet it <hi>for a ſign,</hi> as the words may be rendred from the Hebrew Text.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65506:122"/>who would not believe unleſs he ſaw the print of the nails.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>time</hi> of his death, and that agrees with the type of it, I mean the Paſchal Lamb: For <hi>Chriſt is our Paſſeover who is ſacrificed for us,</hi> (1 Cor. 5.7.) and to this purpoſe, It will be well worth our while to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the preciſe time of ſlaying the Paſchal Lamb, that great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent type of our Saviour's death, and to conſider how well it agrees with the time of of our Saviour's death: Now 'tis expreſly commanded that the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb ſhould be killed <hi>in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Exod. 12.6. And we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what that expreſſion does import.</p>
               <p>Our Marginal reading will be of uſe in this enquiry, which inſtead of, <hi>in the evening</hi> renders it, <hi>between the two evenings,</hi> and that not without the warranty of the Hebrew Text: There is great variety in the ſeveral verſions of theſe words among the Ancient and Modern Tranſlators: I do not intend to repreſent that variety in this place. Some of them are very reconcileable to the ſenſe of the original, others agree very exactly with it, and indeed I have not met with any more wide among
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65506:122"/>the Moderns than that of <hi>Caſtalio</hi> who very ill renders it, <hi>ſub crepuſculum</hi> i. e. about the twylight; as if the Paſchal Lamb were not to be ſlain till it began to be dark, which is ſo fond a conceit, that I ſhall not need do any more than name it. <hi>Jun.</hi> and <hi>Tremell.</hi> keep ſtrictly to the original Text, &amp; render it <hi>inter duas Veſperas, between the two evenings.</hi> It is my buſineſs to inquire what is meant by this expreſſion, <hi>between the two evenings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by the way, I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the interpretation of <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> upon this place, who gives us this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the two evenings. The firſt he would have to be the time when the Sun ſets, the ſecond when the remaining light after Sun-ſet leaves the earth; between theſe two, he ſuppoſes the ſpace of an hour and three quarters or thereabouts: This interpretation agrees well with <hi>Caſtali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o's ſub crepuſculum,</hi> but 'tis an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that is extravagant; for beſides that, it does not allow of a clear light for the remaining ſervice after the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Paſchal Lamb, nor yet give time enough for the whole ſervice of the ſolemnity; beſides this I ſay, the Authour of this interpretation ſeems to quit it, and betake himſelf to another
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65506:123"/>in his following words. For he, being preſſed by an objection againſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, which he attempts not to anſwer, confeſſes that there was a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition among them, which obliges them to kill the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb after the Sun did evidently decline from its meridian.</p>
               <p>We are therefore ſtill to ſeek what is meant by this expreſſion, <hi>between the two evenings,</hi> in which time the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were obliged to kill the Paſchal Lamb, and then to ſee whether this preciſe circumſtance of time were alſo fulfilled in the death of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Now for the better underſtanding of this expreſſion, we muſt know that as the <hi>Jews</hi> day conſiſted of twelve hours, ſo all their ſorenoon was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>morning,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 11.9.</note> and from thence all the afternoon was accounted <hi>evening:</hi> And then their evening was divided into two, <hi>viz.</hi> the former and the latter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening: The former evening was <hi>veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera declinationis,</hi> and was to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their ſixth hour, or our twelve at noon, to Sun-ſet; for from that time the Sun declined from its <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or height. Their latter evening was <hi>veſpera occaſus,</hi> their Sun-ſetting; ſo that the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65506:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>time between the Sun's declenſion and ſetting is that time which is between the two evenings. Let us then conſider what warrant we have for this. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, the holy Scripture ſeems to give us ground to believe that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> day was divided into theſe two evenings. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we read that the unclean perſon was to be removed out of the camp, and it is added, <hi>But it ſhall be when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cometh on</hi> (that is, in the former evening as the following words aſſure us) <hi>he ſhall waſh himſelf with water.</hi> And when the Sun is down (there is the latter evening) <hi>he ſhall come into the camp,</hi> Deut. 23. v. 11. Of the former evening are thoſe words ſpoken, where 'tis ſaid of the <hi>Levite</hi> and his Wife that they tarried <hi>untill after noon</hi> (or <hi>till the day declined,</hi> as 'tis in the Hebrew) <hi>and they did eat both of them.</hi> And then 'tis added by the <hi>Levite</hi>'s Father-in-law, <hi>Behold now the day draweth towards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,</hi> and, <hi>the day groweth to an end,</hi> Judg. 19.8, 9. Of the ſame evening the following words ſeem to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: <hi>And it came to paſs in an evening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, that David aroſe from off his bed,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Sam. 11.2. What we render,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65506:124"/>
                  <hi>in an evening-tide,</hi> the vulgar renders <hi>poſt meridiem,</hi> i. e. afternoon: Nor does it ſeem to be tranſlated amiſs. For it was the cuſtome in thoſe Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to take reſt after dinner: Of this we have an inſtance in the place where it is ſaid that <hi>Rechab and Baanah went, and came about the heat of the day, to the houſe of Iſhboſheth who lay on a bed at noon,</hi> 2 Sam. 4.5. Of the latter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening we have mention, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 10.26, 27. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.32. And it is very obſervable to my preſent purpoſe that what St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us was done when the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>wear away,</hi>

St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us was done when it was <hi>evening,</hi> (Mat. 14.15.) that is, in the former evening; for that is evident not onely from the words of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> but from what follows in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> after thoſe words: For after <hi>Chriſt</hi> had fed five thouſand, and the fragments taken up, and the multitude ſent away (all which took up ſome conſiderable time) it is ſaid that <hi>Chriſt</hi> went apart into a mountain, and then again the Text ſays, <hi>when the evening was come he was there alone,</hi> v. 23. which muſt be the latter evening, for it cannot
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65506:124"/>be that which is mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I add, to what I have ſaid before, the teſtimony of <hi>R. Solomon</hi> on the place, who gives us this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of theſe words, <hi>between the two evenings,</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> i. e. <hi>From ſix hours and upwards is called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two evenings, becauſe the Sun declines then towards its going down,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that according to him there are <hi>two evenings,</hi> that of the <hi>declination</hi> of the Sun, and the <hi>latter evening,</hi> which we call night. And he affirms the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medial time between theſe two to be what is meant here by <hi>between. the two evenings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, With what hath been ſaid let us compare the practice of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh nation which will ſhew how the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion underſtood theſe words. We find that it was commanded that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual burnt offering was to be offered alſo <hi>between the two evenings,</hi> Num. 28.4. This was the preciſe time of the daily evening ſacrifice. And what the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh practice was we may beſt learn from their writings.<note place="margin">Peſach. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>m.</hi> 1.</note> In the <hi>Miſhua</hi> we read their practice. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> That is, <hi>the daily evening ſacrifice was killed at the eighth hour and an half</hi> (and that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65506:125"/>to our half an hour after two a clock) <hi>and it was offered up at the ninth hour and an half;</hi> that is, at half an hour after three; <hi>In the evening of the Paſſeover it was killed at half an hour after the ſeventh hour, and offered up at half an hour after the eighth— And if the Eve of the Paſſeover fell upon the Eve of the Sabbath it was ſlain half an hour after the ſixth hour</hi> (that is, half an hour paſt our twelve a clock) <hi>and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up half an hour after the ſeventh hour</hi> (that is, at our half an hour paſt one) <hi>and the Paſſover after it.</hi> Hence then we may perceive that though the <hi>Jews</hi> were commanded to offer their daily evening ſacrifice between <hi>the two even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> they did ordinarily offer it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ninth hour (or half an hour after three a clock) which was alſo the time of prayer; (<hi>Act.</hi> 3.1.) or that time of prayer which among the <hi>Jews</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65506:125"/>and Sun-ſet, which is the latter even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. What they were required to doe between the two evenings, that they did about the ninth hour of the day, which was the intermedial ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two evenings. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the continual or daily evening ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and Paſchal Lamb alſo were to be ſlain and offered up between the two evenings, we find the daily ſacrifice was firſt to be offered up, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore began ſooner, but then that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at the earlieſt did not begin till paſt noon, and then the Paſſeover ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded into that time which was in the ſtricteſt and exacteſt ſenſe between the two evenings. <hi>Vid.</hi> Maimon.

                  <note place="margin">Joſeph. <hi>Antiqu. l.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> who muſt needs be ſuppoſed very well to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the uſages of his own people: He tells us, ſpeaking of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s laying ſiege to the Temple, that it did not hinder the Prieſts from their ſervice at the ſame time, which, ſays he, was performed at that time at the Altar twice a day: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>at which time they ſlay their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the ninth to the eleventh hour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt what hath been ſaid it may be objected from <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 6. That the Paſchal Lamb was to be ſlain at Sun-ſet. The words are theſe—<hi>There thou ſhalt ſacrifice the Paſſeover at even, at the going down of the Sun, at the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that thou cameſt forth out of Egypt.</hi> By which words it ſeams to be implied that the going down of the Sun was the ſet time when the Paſſeover was to be ſlain. In anſwer to which I deſire theſe particulars may be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That from thoſe words it may be as well concluded that the Paſſeover was to be ſacrificed at the ſeaſon of their coming forth out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid, <hi>There thou ſhalt ſacrifice the Paſſeover at even, at the going down of the Sun, at the ſeaſon that thou cameſt forth out of Egypt.</hi> Now, if by the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in which they came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> we underſtand the preciſe time when they came thence, we ſhall find that it was neither in the evening, nor at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, but very far removed from it; 'tis expreſly ſaid that God brought
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65506:126"/>them out of <hi>Egypt by night,</hi> v. 1. And this is farther confirmed from what we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12, 29, 30, 31.</p>

For though it follow at the <hi>going down of the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. it does not therefore hence follow that thoſe words relate to the ſame matter. For the proof of this I ſhall need go no farther than to the ſecond verſe of this Chapter; there it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt therefore ſacrifice the Paſſeover unto the Lord thy God, of the flock and the herd.</hi> Where 'tis evident that the <hi>flock</hi> relates to the Paſſeover onely, according to the law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.3, 5.

               <p>So that by this time it will not be hard to underſtand what is meant by <hi>between the two evenings,</hi> which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the time of the daily evening ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>Num.</hi> 28.4. which was wont to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65506:127"/>be offered up about our three in the afternoon, or their ninth hour, which was alſo a ſtated time of prayer. (<hi>Act.</hi> 3.1.) It is evident that the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt deelining of the Sun to its ſetting is that time which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Evenings; And then our three a clock, or their ninth hour, when the day conſiſts of twelve hours, is the exact middle between the two Evenings. Let us now ſee how well the time of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s death agrees with this.</p>
               <p>And that it ſeems to do very exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for beſides that he was Crucified at the Paſſeover, ſo he ſeems to have dyed about that moment of time when they were wont to ſlay the Paſchal Lamb, which as I have ſhewed was about their ninth hour. They begin to Crucifie him at the third hour of the day (<hi>Mark.</hi> 15.25.) at the <hi>ſixth</hi> hour there was darkneſs over the whole land, untill the <hi>ninth</hi> hour (<hi>v.</hi> 33.) at the ninth hour he cries out, <hi>my God, my God,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>v.</hi> 34.) and preſently upon that we read that he gave up the Ghoſt (<hi>v.</hi> 37.) And that all this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened before the latter Evening (and ſo conſequently between the two Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings)
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65506:128"/>appears from <hi>v.</hi> 42, 43. where we read that when <hi>even was come Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> begs the body of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> So that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Paſſeover, the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of the Paſchal Lamb dyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Evenings; And as in other particulars our Lord did fully anſwer what was typified of him in that Sacrifice, ſo he does alſo in the time of his death, which was about the ninth hour which was the preciſe time of ſlaying the Paſchal Lamb.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>place</hi> of our Saviour's death. This was alſo prefigured of old and fulfilled in the death of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> We know that the Sacrifices of old were not to be offered up any where but within the camp at firſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the place which God had choſen to place which God had choſen to place his name there. Our Lord who was to ſuffer, and to be ſlain a Sacrifice for our ſins, did ſuffer in that place.</p>
               <p>In that City he was accuſed, and condemned and abuſed, and afterwards <hi>without the Gate</hi> he ſuffered death, as ſome of the Sin-offerings under the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> were burnt without the <hi>Camp.</hi> The City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Camp in the Wilderneſs, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65506:128"/>what was done without the Camp at firſt was, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was choſen, to be done without the Gates of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty [<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.11.]</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let us conſider ſtill more particularly the manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the death of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and we ſhall find what was of old predicted and prefigured was fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus.</hi> As for example,</p>
               <p>That he was betrayed by his own Diſciple, the Evangeliſts report: And this the Pſalmiſt had foretold long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in theſe words. <hi>Mine own familiar friend in whom I truſted, which did eat of my bread, hath lift up his heel againſt me.</hi> And what St. <hi>John</hi> reports is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable to this purpoſe; when our Saviour had told his Diſciples that they were not all clean, intimating that one of them ſhould betray him; he tells us what our Saviour adds. <hi>I ſpeak not of you all, I know whom I have choſen: but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, he that eateth bread with me hath lift up his heel againſt me.</hi> Now (ſays our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>I tell you before it come, that when it is come to paſs ye may believe that I am he,</hi> (v. 18, 19.) His meaning is that they ſhould be confirmed in their
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65506:129"/>belief of him, when they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the treachery of <hi>Judas</hi> which was predicted by the Pſalmiſt, and foretold by himſelf. [<hi>Joh.</hi> 18.2. with <hi>Pſalm</hi> 41.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.10, 11.]</p>
               <p>That he was betrayed for thirty pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Silver we read in the Goſpel, and the ſame was foretold by the Prophet <hi>Zechary,</hi> and not onely that but alſo the uſe that this money was put to, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>buying the Potters field,</hi> [Matt. 26.15. and 27.7, 8, 9. with <hi>Zechar.</hi> 11.12, 13.]</p>
               <p>That he was crucified between two Thieves, the Evangeliſts report, and the Prophet long before had foretold that he ſhould be numbred with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors. And our Saviour a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death tells his Diſciples of it in theſe words.<note place="margin">Luk. 22.37.</note> 
                  <hi>For I ſay unto you, that this that is written muſt yet be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in me: and he was reckoned among the tranſgreſſors. For the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me have an end,</hi> [Matt. 27.38. with Iſai. 53.12.]</p>
               <p>When he was upon the Croſs there was given him Vinegar to drink, and no leſs was foretold by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>in my thirſt they gave me Vinegar to drink.</hi> And our Saviour's thirſt at that time
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65506:129"/>was to verifie that prediction. <hi>Jeſus knowing that all things were now accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ſaith, I thirſt.</hi> Upon which they gave him Vinegar to drink. This is the more remarkable ſtill, becauſe it was contrary to the conſtant cuſtome and courteſie of the Nation, to give him that was condemned to die Vinegar to drink: For whereas ſuch a ſharp liquor is apt to awaken to a ſenſe of pain, the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to give ſuch perſons a ſtupifying or Narcotick potion to ruffle and diſorder their minds that they might not attend unto their pain,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Maimon.</hi> H. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedr. c. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe in a cup of Wine. For this they ground themſelves on the words of <hi>Solomon. Give ſtrong drink to him that is ready to periſh, and wine to thoſe that be of heavy heart. Let him drink and forget his poverty, and remember his miſery no more.</hi> This was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and there is a tradition among them, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were at this charge of their own good will, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poor Sufferers. But for all this practice, what God foretold was fulfilled. [<hi>Matt.</hi> 27.48. with <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69.21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.28, 29. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.6, 7.]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:65506:130"/>The Souldiers when they had cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Jeſus,</hi> part his garments, and made four parts, to every Souldier a part; but when they came to his coat, which it ſeems was woven and without a ſeam, becauſe they could not part that, they <hi>ſaid among themſelves let us not rend it, but caſt lots for it whoſe it ſhall be.</hi> And ſo this ſeemed to be a very caſual and contingent thing; yet was this not without the particular providence of God in order to fulfill the prophecy of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>they part my garments among them, and caſt lots upon my veſture.</hi> [<hi>Pſalm</hi> 18.22. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.23, 24.]</p>
               <p>The Pſalmiſt predicted of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in theſe words. <hi>All they that ſee me laugh me to ſcorn, they ſhoot out the lip, they ſhake the head, ſaying: He truſted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, ſeeing he delighted in him.</hi> Let us hear now what the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt tells us as to the verifying of this prophecy: He tells us that when <hi>Jeſus</hi> was crucified, they that paſſed by <hi>reviled him, wagging their head, and ſaying, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple and buildeſt it in three days ſave thy ſelf; if thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſs:</hi> There were others that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65506:130"/>ſaid, <hi>He ſaved others, himſelf he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave: If he be the King of Iſrael let him now come down from the Croſs, and we will believe him. He truſted in God, let him deliver him now if he will have him.</hi> [Pſalm 22.7, 8. <hi>with</hi> Mat. 27.39.]</p>
               <p>The Pſalmiſt reports the very words which the <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſpeak upon the Croſs. <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And we find that <hi>Jeſus</hi> about the ninth hour cryed out <hi>Eli, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, Lama ſabacthani?</hi> i. e. <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And if the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tell us when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that he poured <hi>out his ſoul unto death,</hi> that he did alſo <hi>make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the tranſgreſſors;</hi> I am ſure St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when he was upon the Croſs <hi>interceded</hi> for his greateſt Enemies, praying for them and ſaying <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> Pſalm 22.1. with Mat. 27.46. Iſai. 53.12. with Luk. 23.34.]</p>
               <p>The ſame Prophet deſcribes the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſufferings of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in theſe words, <hi>He was oppreſſed and he was af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a Sheep before her Shearers is dumb,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65506:131"/>ſo he opened not his mouth.</hi> Never was this Scripture ſo eminently fulfilled as it was by <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He endured his pain and contempt with a moſt unparallelled patience: He was betrayed by a <hi>falſe Diſciple,</hi> and with a <hi>fraudulent kiſs:</hi> Another ſwears he does not know him; the reſt leave him in his extremity: He is ſtricken by the hand of a rude Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, oppreſſed in the place of Judgment, condemned to die without ſufficient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; he is ſpit upon, buffeted, hooted at and reviled. They carry him from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> before whom he anſwers with <hi>ſilence</hi> and an <hi>unheard of patience:</hi> From <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> he is conveyed to <hi>Herod,</hi> and is ſilent before him alſo; thence he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Pilate;</hi> neither one nor the other could find any fault with him. His enemies thirſt for his bloud, are loud and clamorous, our Lord who ſuffers holds his peace. [<hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.9, 11, 14.]</p>
               <p>Though the ſufferings of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> were particularly predicted as hath been ſaid, and they were very ſevere: yet we are aſſured that a <hi>bone of him ſhould not be broken.</hi> This was intimated in the Law of the Paſchal Lamb (a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65506:131"/>type of the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) by which it was provided that not a <hi>bone</hi> of the Lamb ſhould be broken.<note place="margin">Abravenel <hi>in</hi> Ex. 12.</note> This is ſaid to have been ſo appointed for the honour of the holy oblation; and was of perpetual obligation, and not peculiar to the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now this was actually fulfilled in the body of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> though it were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely it ſhould have happened ſo. For beſides that our Saviour's enemies were barbarouſly cruel towards him, they had a cuſtom among them to break the legs of the crucified, and were at this time eſpecially carefull about it, becauſe of their approaching Sabbath; and had actually broken the bones of the two Malefactors which hung by him; and were come to the body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> for the ſame end: But finding him dead they pierced his ſide, but brake not his bones; not without a very remarkable provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. And this was done that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <hi>A bone of him ſhall not be brokea.</hi> [Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 12.46. Joh. 19.36.]</p>
               <p>If what hath been ſaid be conſidered duely, we ſhall have great cauſe from the ſufferings of <hi>Jeſus</hi> to believe him to be the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:65506:132"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> I come now to enquire into the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or reaſons of the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it cannot be ſuppoſed that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was a moſt innocent perſon, ſhould ſuffer a moſt painfull and ignominious death, without ſome weighty cauſe and great ends. And what thoſe are you may learn from the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſuffered in our <hi>ſtead,</hi> and to <hi>procure</hi> our <hi>pardon</hi> and acceptance, and Salvation. We do believe that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>for us men and our Salvation;</hi> and maintain againſt the followers of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that this death was a <hi>piacular Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and that his ſufferings were a <hi>vicarious puniſhment</hi> upon the account, and for the expiation of our ſins: Or, that he died to make ſatisfaction for our ſins.</p>
               <p>For the proving of this, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the holy Scriptures, and we ſhall find that they do abundantly teach us this truth.</p>
               <p>It is granted on all hands that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (Chap. LIII.) ſpeaks of the ſufferings of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And he gives us ſuch an account of them, as ſpeaks them to be undergone not onely for <hi>our ſakes</hi> but in <hi>our ſtead</hi> alſo. Thus
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65506:132"/>he is ſaid to <hi>bear our griefs,</hi> and <hi>carry our ſorrows,</hi> (v. 4.) And if thoſe words do not import this ſenſe yet thoſe which follow do very much confirm us in this belief: <hi>He was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> (v. 5.) Theſe words do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly import that the <hi>fault</hi> was ours, and that for that <hi>fault</hi> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſuffered. It was <hi>our</hi> tranſgreſſion and <hi>our</hi> iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the wounds and bruiſes due to them fell upon <hi>him.</hi> The chaſtiſement and ſtripes were <hi>his,</hi> the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> thereby procured, belong unto <hi>us.</hi> In a word, though we finned, and were liable to ſuffer upon that account yet he ſuffered for us: If this be not plain enough let us proceed: <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray: we have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi> (v. 6.) The plain and natural ſenſe of which words is this, that whereas we had ſinned and had made our ſelves obnoxious to puniſhment, yet God did not puniſh us as we deſerved, but the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in our room and ſtead. To the ſame purpoſe we read afterward: <hi>He
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65506:133"/>was cut off out of the land of the living, for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken.</hi> (v. 8.) And after thoſe words we read that his <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhould be made an <hi>offering for ſin.</hi> (v. 10.) It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that a ſin or treſpaſs-offering under the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>expiatory</hi> and <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acular,</hi> and the beaſt was offered inſtead of the offender; and God did accept the bloud of the ſacrifice in the room of the life of the perſon who had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider what we read in the New Teſtament to the ſame purpoſe: Our Bleſſed Saviour in his ſolemn pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a little before his paſſion, hath theſe words: <hi>For their ſakes</hi> (ſpeaking of his Diſciples) <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the truth.</hi> That is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> did offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a <hi>victim</hi> or ſacrifice for them, as the Greek word is obſerved to ſignifie: And that ſacrifice alſo is to be looked upon as a piacular and expiatory one. And to that purpoſe it is well obſerved that the prayer (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17.1, 2, &amp;c.) by which <hi>Chriſt</hi> conſecrated himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his death is like unto that which the Jewiſh High Prieſt uſed when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated or offered up the victims of the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65506:133"/>day of expiation before the <hi>Altar.</hi> [Joh. 17.19.]</p>
               <p>Agreeably to what hath been ſaid St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells us, that <hi>God hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin.</hi> Of which words I can give no other ſenſe but this, <hi>viz.</hi> that though <hi>Chriſt</hi> were innocent himſelf yet God thought fit to give him up to death, as a piacular ſacrifice for our ſins. And to the ſame purpoſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that <hi>Chriſt bare our ſins in his own body on the tree.</hi> [2 Cor. 5.22. 1 Pet. 11.24.]</p>
               <p>The divine Authour of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did by <hi>himſelf purge our ſins:</hi> And that he was <hi>once offered to bear the ſins of many.</hi> And that he offered <hi>one ſacrifice</hi> for <hi>ſins.</hi> [Heb. 1.3. c. 9.28.1.10.12.]</p>
               <p>And we find that the expiation of our ſins is imputed to the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Holy Scriptures. <hi>We have an altar whereof they have no right to eat, which ſerve the Tabernacle. For the bodies of thoſe beaſts, whoſe bloud is brought into the ſanctuary by the High Prieſt for ſin, are burnt without the camp. Wherefore Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus alſo, that he might ſanctifie the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with his own bloud, ſuffered without the gate.</hi> By <hi>ſanctifying</hi> the people no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65506:134"/>leſs can be meant than the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſins, and as this was done under the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> by an expiatory ſacrifice, ſo was it done by the bloud of <hi>Jeſus</hi> (the anti-type of thoſe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which he ſpeaks of in that place) <hi>who ſuffered without the gate.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> tells us that the bloud of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> cleanſeth us from all ſin. [<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7.]</p>
               <p>And this is farther confirmed to us from this that our Saviour's bloud is ſaid to be a <hi>price</hi> paid for us, by which we are <hi>bought</hi> and <hi>redeemed. For this cauſe he is the Mediatour of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that by means of death for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called may receive the promiſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal inheritance.</hi> To which I ſhall add thoſe words of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> where ſpeaking of <hi>Chriſt</hi> he ſaith, <hi>In whom we have redemption through his bloud:</hi> And to the <hi>Coloſſians, In whom we have redemption through his bloud, even the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> [Heb. 9.15. Eph. 1.7. Col. 1.14.]</p>
               <p>To what hath been ſaid very much may be added to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that our Lord himſelf hath ſaid
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65506:134"/>that he came to <hi>give</hi> his life a <hi>ranſom for many.</hi> (Matt. 20.28.) That of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the ſame purpoſe (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6.) And thoſe words of our Lord, <hi>This is my bloud of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins</hi> (Matt. 26.28.) Again theſe words of the Apoſtle: <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law; being made a curſe for us.</hi> (Gal. 3.13.) <hi>Chriſt</hi> is elſewhere ſaid to be the <hi>propitiation for our ſins.</hi> [1 Joh. 4.10.]</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to add any more Teſtimonies to thoſe already named: For though there are many others yet theſe are ſufficient: And indeed they do ſo plainly acquaint us with the end of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> death that he muſt uſe great art that can ſtrain them to another ſenſe.</p>
               <p>For what the <hi>Socinians</hi> object againſt this doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that it renders God's kindneſs leſs (which yet is greatly magnified in the Scripture) in giving his Son: This objection I ſay can be of no force at all.</p>
               <p>For though God thought fit for the honour of his juſtice that ſin ſhould not altogether go unpuniſhed, and gave us his Son to make our peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65506:135"/>us from miſery with his pretious bloud, yet is this no diminution to the free grace and mercy of God. 'Twas the infinite mercy of God which moved him to find out this way, in which we can claim nothing. 'Twas intirely the mercy of God that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us this remedy. Our pardon is free to us whatever it coſt our Lord to procure it. We have great cauſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the love of God, and the unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled charity of our Bleſſed Saviour. Our <hi>free pardon,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt's redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> the infinite <hi>mercy</hi> of God, and the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of his juſtice are not things that are inconſiſtent. The Apoſtles words teach us this truth, with which I ſhall conclude this particular. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through faith in his bloud; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt through the forbearance of God. To declare I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi> [Rom. 3. v. 24, 25, 26.]</p>
               <p>And thus I have conſidered the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a ſacrifice for ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65506:135"/>as a great inſtance of the love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was content to dye that we might live. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we are exhorted to love one another we are preſſed to it from this conſideration. <hi>Walk in love as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for an offering, and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour</hi> [Eph. 5.2.]</p>
               <p n="2">2. The death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the death of a <hi>Teſtator;</hi> for ſo is <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be conſidered alſo. He himſelf calls his bloud the <hi>bloud of the New Teſtament,</hi> or the <hi>New Teſtament in his bloud.</hi> I very well know that the <hi>Greek</hi> word, which we render <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> does ſignifie <hi>Covenant;</hi> but yet it does not always do ſo in the New Teſtament. For ſometimes it ſignifies the <hi>laſt Will or Teſtament</hi> of a <hi>Teſtator.</hi> And when it does ſo it does not exclude the notion of a Covenant neither, but rather imply it. For the right we have to the inheritance is one part of the Covenant, but then the declaration of that right is peculiarly and properly the part of a Teſtament; which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the laſt will of a man by which he diſpoſeth of his goods. [<hi>Matt.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.20.]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:65506:136"/>Our Bleſſed Saviour is ſaid to be the <hi>heir of all things.</hi> And we are elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where told that, the Father <hi>loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</hi> And we are farther informed upon what account it is that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loveth the Son (and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath given all things into his hands) in theſe words of our Saviour, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life.</hi> From whence it is Evident that upon the account of the voluntary death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> this full pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority is given to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the great <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and man: <hi>Chriſt</hi> was in the form of God, and <hi>thought it not robbery to be equal with God; But made himſelf of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men, and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> [Heb. 1.2. Joh. 3.35, 10, 17. Phil. 2.6.]</p>
               <p>Thus low did the Son of God ſtoop for our Salvation, from being <hi>equal</hi> with <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> and from the <hi>form</hi> of God to that of a <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi> from <hi>life</hi> to <hi>death,</hi> from <hi>glory</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:65506:136"/>to <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>contempt:</hi> If you would know the effects of all this, the next words will inform us: <hi>Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; That at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth: and that every tongue ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord to the glory of God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour a little before his death bequeaths a Kingdom to his followers as a <hi>Teſtator</hi> in theſe words, and <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom,</hi>

               <p>But then by his death he procured our right to this glorious inheritance. For where a <hi>Teſtament</hi> is, there muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of neceſſity be the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator.</hi> For a Teſtament is of force af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men are dead: otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all whilſt the Teſtator liveth. 'Tis the death of the Teſtator that makes way to the Heir: He hath no claim till the Teſtator dye. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his death his title is unqueſtionable, and it is not in any man's power to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what is thus ſetled and confirmed.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65506:137"/>Though it be but a man's Teſtament, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulleth or addeth thereto. [<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Our Lord ſuffered the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and painfull death: He did this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and not by Conſtraint. He dyed not inteſtate, nor yet like other Teſtators, who when they have made their Teſtaments do avoid death with all their care and skill, and are not willing to part with their lives for the benefit of their Heirs or Succeſſours. 'Twas otherwiſe with our Saviour: <hi>I lay down my life</hi> (ſays he) <hi>no man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it from me but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and have power to take it again.</hi> [Joh. 10.17, 18.]</p>
               <p>Now after Chriſt had ſuffered death and riſen from the dead he tells his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the plenitude of his power and authority. <hi>All power is given unto me</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in heaven and in earth.</hi> And a while after his own aſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, he ſends the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>which is the earneſt of our inheritance.</hi> [Mat. 28.18. Eph. 1.14.]</p>
               <p n="3">3. The death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the death of a <hi>Martyr</hi> or a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65506:137"/>
                  <hi>Witneſs.</hi> Our Bleſſed Saviour had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf to be the light of the World, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had foretold, and that he came from heaven, and that he was the <hi>Chriſt the Son of the Bleſſed.</hi> It is of great moment that theſe truths ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confirmed to us: Upon theſe things depends the whole Religion that he taught. If theſe things be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved, we can make no doubt of the truth of any part of the Doctrine which <hi>Jeſus</hi> taught. [<hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. c. 5.39, 6, 40. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.61, 62.]</p>
               <p>Now it will appear that the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> does mightily confirm theſe truths, and that <hi>Jeſus</hi> gave up himſelf to death for the ſame end and purpoſe. When <hi>Pilate</hi> asked <hi>Jeſus</hi> whether he were a <hi>King</hi> or not; <hi>Jeſus</hi> anſwered, <hi>thou ſayeſt that I am a King</hi> [that is, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> anſwered in the affirmative] <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the World, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth.</hi> With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the undaunted courage of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> before <hi>Pilate</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pontius Pilate he witneſſed a good confeſſion.</hi> [Joh. 18.37. 1 Tim. 6.13.]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:65506:138"/>'Twas upon this account that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was put to death: He was accuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of ſomething elſe that was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him. But the Teſtimony was weak and incoherent; that with which he was born down was that he profeſſed himſelf to be <hi>Chriſt</hi> a <hi>King:</hi> Or, as it is in St. <hi>John,</hi> becauſe <hi>he made himſelf the Son of God.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was ſilent when the falſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes accuſed him. But when the High Prieſt asked him, if he were the <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Son of the Bleſſed; and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>I am,</hi> &amp;c. We find thereupon the High Prieſt renting his Cloaths and ſaying, <hi>what need we any farther wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? ye have heard the blaſphemy, what think ye? and they all condemned him to be worthy of death.</hi> [Luk. 23.2. Joh. 19.7. Mark 14.61.]</p>
               <p>Our Saviour dyed for his adhering to this great truth, and that he did ſo, muſt be acknowledged a great confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it and of the Religion which he planted, Life is too ſweet a thing to be trifled away for nothing: Much leſs will a man in his wits dye in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a lye: Had <hi>Jeſus</hi> been diſpoſed he might have kept out of the way of his enemies, or have ſaved himſelf by
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65506:138"/>denying the truth: He had now a great temptation before him either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce what he had profeſſed, or by ſome trick or mean art or other to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the danger. But he is far from taking any ſuch courſe to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but inſtead thereof confirms the truth with his own Bloud. He was ſo far from diſowning himſelf to be the Son of God, that he continues in that profeſſion to the laſt breath. And when he hung upon the Croſs he twice calls God his father, when he prayed for his enemies and gave up the Ghoſt. This did mightily confirm his Doctrine, and was one great end of his ſufferings. [<hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34.46.]</p>
               <p>Hence it is that the bloud (or the ſufferings of Chriſt, eſpecially his death) is reckoned among thoſe who bear witneſs in earth. And Jeſus Chriſt is called the faithfull witneſs. And we are then ſaid to be partakers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when we hold the beginning of our Confidence ſted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſt unto the end. [1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5.]</p>
               <p>The bloud of Chriſt did not onely waſh away our ſins, but did alſo clear the innocency of our Bleſſed Saviour. And it was attended with ſo many
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65506:139"/>rare circumſtances, and fulfilled ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prophecies, and was born with ſuch an admirable patience, that it did convince men of the innocence of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and conſequently of the truth of his Doctrine. The veil of the Temple was rent, the earth did quake, the rocks clave in ſunder, and graves were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Sun drew in its light, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Centurion that beheld theſe things could not forbear to ſay, <hi>Truly this was the Son of God.</hi> [Mat. 27.54.]</p>
               <p>And no wonder after all this that thoſe who renounced Chriſtianity are ſaid to count the bloud of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (<hi>i. e.</hi> the bloud by which the new Covenant was ratified and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) wherewith he was ſanctified (that is <hi>Chriſt</hi> was conſecrated or ſanctified ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19) an unholy thing <hi>i. e.</hi> the bloud not of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon but of a Criminal. [<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.]</p>
               <p>Having conſidered the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the death of a <hi>Victim</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> of a <hi>Teſtatour,</hi> and of a <hi>Martyr</hi> or <hi>Witneſs;</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gave us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> 1. Pet. 2.20. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gave us a moſt excellent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his whole life: But then at his death he gave us alſo a very eminent example of the following vertues and graces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Patience</hi> and meekneſs under all his ſufferings and reproaches. And his example was without a parallel. Never was there ſo great a mirrour of theſe graces. <hi>He did no ſin, neither was there guile ſound in his mouth. Who when he was reviled, reviled not again: when he ſuffered he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſly.</hi> In this <hi>Jeſus</hi> was ſo conſpicuous that when we are exhorted to Patience we are directed to <hi>look</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, the <hi>authour and finiſher of our faith.</hi> And it will be a very uſefull meditation for us under all our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and all the reproaches which we meet withall. He was guilty of no ſin, but yet was numbred among tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. He had but few followers, and by one of them he is Letrayed, denied
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65506:140"/>by another, and in his greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity forſaken by all the reſt. He is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced innocent and yet ſentenced to death by the ſame breath, abſolved and condemned by one and the ſame Judge. He is forced to bear his own Croſs, reviled and buffeted, derided and ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at by an inhumane multitude whom he came to ſave, and whom he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged by the greateſt benefactions. He was innocent and deſerved not this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, Omnipotent and able to revenge it: But inſtead of that he does not ſo much as threaten thoſe whom he could eaſily have deſtroyed; He bears all with an unparallelled meekneſs and patience, and made it appear that theſe vertues were as invincible as his cauſe was juſt. He is ſilent under the greateſt clamours of his Enemies, His perſecutours have leſs patience than he that ſuffers. And when the whole creation trembles, when the Sun withdraws its light, and the rocks rend in pieces, and the graves give up their dead, and the Veil of the Temple is torn in pieces, then is <hi>Jeſus</hi> quiet and ſtill: This example does moſt powerfully reprove our peeviſhneſs and diſcontent, our anger and our heat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obloquy and other ſufferings
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65506:140"/>which we endure and generally have deſerved. [1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22, 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2.]</p>
               <p n="2">II. Of <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of <hi>Enemies.</hi> They were our Lord's enemies to whom he was the greateſt friend. And of all Enemies 'tis the hardeſt to forgive them. He that <hi>did eat of his bread lift up his heel againſt him.</hi> His own Diſciple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays him, and his own People thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his bloud, and his wounds he receives from thoſe whom he came to ſeek and ſave. A robber is preferred before him, and he is numbred with tranſgreſſours. He had fed their hungry, healed their ſick, diſpoſſeſſed their Daemoniacks, reſtored ſight to their blind, given ſtrength to their infirm, life to their dead: Many good turns he had done them, and yet they treat him rudely and barbarouſly, they cry to have him Crucified, and inſult over him in his ſufferings; what doth our Lord do all this while? does he call for Fire from Heaven to devour his enemies? Does he menace them with an approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching deſtruction? Does he exclaim againſt their proceedings? No: he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not his mouth unleſs it be to pray for theſe his Enemies. <hi>Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them,</hi> &amp;c. can we remember theſe
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65506:141"/>things and bear a grudge againſt our Brother? Can it now be hard for us to forgive our enemies when <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his laſt breath prayed for his? <hi>Chriſt</hi> forgave and he died for our forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and is it now a poſſible thing for us not to forgive even then when we commemorate the death of <hi>Chriſt? Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you, with all malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, Even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> [Luk. 23.34. Eph. 4.31, 32.]</p>
               <p n="3">III. Of the <hi>profoundeſt humility</hi> and condeſcenſion: The world never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a pattern of this grace which could compare with this of our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's. He ſtooped from Heaven to earth when he was born. From the immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and happineſs, the power and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a God, to the limits of a womb, the miſeries of a man, the proportions and infirmities of a Child, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of a Mortal, and the humble cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of a poor and mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If we look upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the manger we ſhall ſee a glorious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of humility. But if we turn our
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65506:141"/>eyes upon him as he hung upon the Croſs we ſhall ſee an example great enough to extinguiſh out of our minds every proud thought for ever. Here we may ſee him who was found in the faſhion of a man humbling himſelf low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtill as he was obedient <hi>unto death even the death of the Croſs.</hi> [Philip. 2.8.]</p>
               <p>Methinks after this we ſhould never be in danger of a proud thought of our ſelves: we cannot ſure after this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think any office too mean for us in which we may do any good office to one another. Here is enough to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh for ever all our ambition and pride, and contempt of our poor Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nothing that we can do can be called a great condeſcenſion after this humiliation of the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Of <hi>reſignation</hi> to the will of God. This our Lord was the moſt conſpicous mirrour and example of. He was a man (ſin onely excepted) like one of us; ſenſible of hunger and thirſt, of pain and ſorrow, and theſe things pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his fleſh as they do ours. His ſoul was ſorrowfull and very heavy: His ſweat was like drops of bloud; great was his agony, and his ſorrow beyond expreſſion. He ſaw before his eyes a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65506:142"/>moſt painfull and a moſt ſhamefull death. He is about to drink a moſt bitter cup. Theſe things were grievous to his humane nature, and therefore he prays that (if it were poſſible) <hi>this cup might paſs from</hi> him; but after all he ſubmits himſelf to the will of God: <hi>Not as I will but as thou wilt.</hi> And how inſtructive is this to us! We ſinners may be aſhamed to murmur when our Lord reſigned himſelf. Well may we ſubmit under our little and deſerved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, when he that was without fault reſigned himſelf up to God. [<hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39.]</p>
               <p n="5">V. Of the greateſt <hi>Charity</hi> to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. <hi>Greater love than this hath no man than that he lay down his life for his friend.</hi> This is the higheſt flight of friendſhip, and we have but a very few examples in our books of ſuch a Degree of Charity. Some few (I'll grant) have done this, none have gone beyond this, beſides our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. For he died for his Enemies and for the Ungodly: This example ſhould conſtrain us to do good to all, even to evil men and to our greateſt Enemies. [<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6.]</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Of the greateſt <hi>fortitude</hi> and the trueſt <hi>courage.</hi> He bore witneſs to the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65506:142"/>truth with his bloud, and was ſtedfaſt in the profeſſion of it to his laſt breath. The moſt ſharp and ſhamefull death, the moſt barbarous uſage and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not prevail upon him to deny the truth, or to fall into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent paſſion, and revenge himſelf. He does in cold bloud chuſe rather to dye the worſt kind of death, than to quit the profeſſion of the truth, or to deſtroy his Enemies. This is indeed an argument of true greatneſs of mind.</p>
               <p>We are much miſtaken in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit about <hi>Valour</hi> or <hi>fortitude.</hi> To <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give</hi> an <hi>Enemy,</hi> and to <hi>chuſe to dye</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to <hi>do</hi> an <hi>evil thing</hi> ſpeaks a generous and a great mind, and is a certain proof of Courage and true Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. But he is a man of a weak mind who will do an evil thing to ſave his life, and revenge himſelf upon him that affronts him or does him wrong; Revenge ſpeaks a defect of wit and courage. The meaneſt creatures they are who are peeviſh and waſpiſh, and prone to bite him that toucheth him. <hi>Leniter qui ſaeviunt ſapiunt magis. Anger reſteth it in the boſom of fools: Non eſt magnus animus quem incurvat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria.</hi> They are but little and feeble
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65506:143"/>folk that are ruffled by every injury or calumny. The more impotent and weak any creature is the more eaſily provoked, and nothing is a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign of a narrow and mean ſoul than is revenge.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> I ſhall now make ſome application of what hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">I. What hath been ſaid may ſerve to recommend to us a ſuffering condition, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſanctified by his own Sufferings. When we ſuffer we are like the Author and finiſher of our faith. It becomes us not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed with our ſufferings who profeſs a faith in a crucified Redeemer. For by ſufferings our Religion was planted, by ſufferings it grew up and prevailed in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:65506:143"/>This was the way in which <hi>Jeſus</hi> went before us into his glory; <hi>And if we ſuffer with him we ſhall likewiſe be glorified together.</hi> It is no little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us to think that our Lord hath led us the ſame way, and that he did overcome the world after this manner, which is indeed the nobleſt conqueſt of it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We may hence be exhorted to a frequent mediation of the death and ſufferings of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Form what hath been ſaid it appears plainly that we are nearly concerned in theſe things: For <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not ſuffer upon his own account but upon ours, and we are very much concerned in the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his death.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>[1.] As we expect our pardon upon the account of his merit and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He was a ſacrifice which made attonement and expiation for our crimes, as he died for our Sins.</item>
                  <item>[2.] As we hope for an eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance upon the account of the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who hath made way for us by his death, and by death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf before into an eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</item>
                  <item>[3.] As we are confirmed in the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65506:144"/>truth of his holy Religion by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his bloud, with which this new covenant between God and man was ratified and confirmed.</item>
                  <item>[4.] As we are conſtrained by the glorious example he gave us in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to patience, and charity, and ſelf-reſignation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which he hath given us the moſt powerfull example.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="3">III. We may hence be exhorted to a frequent and diligent partaking of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which is appointed as a ſtanding memorial of the death of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We ought not onely to embrace but welcome all theſe opportunities, as thoſe which lead us to the contemplation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s death upon which our hopes to depend.</p>
               <p>It is an unſpeakable privilege that we are admitted to this favour: And had we the due ſenſe, which we ought to have upon our minds, of the love of God in giving us his Son, and the love of our Lord in giving up himſelf to death for us, and the unſpeakable benefits which thence accrue to us, we ſhould need no words of perſuaſion, no law or ſecular intereſt to invite us to the doing of that which is ſo plainly
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65506:144"/>our duty, and ſo much our intereſt to doe.</p>
               <p>Our ſpiritual hunger and thirſt are the onely ſafe and laſting principles, as well as the acceptable ones from whence we ought to be moved.</p>
               <p>If our ſouls be once poſſeſſed with an ardent love of God and our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour we ſhall not make excuſes, and ſhall be ſo far from that, that it will not be an eaſie thing to ſtay away; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a violent detention will keep us back.</p>
               <p>And thus I have from the ſufferings of <hi>Jeſus</hi> made it appear that he is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I proceed to ſpeak to the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> I ſhall ſay ſomething of his <hi>Burial.</hi> Of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> it was foretold that he ſhould not onely <hi>die</hi> but be <hi>buried,</hi> and not onely <hi>buried</hi> but <hi>honourably interred</hi> alſo. And what was foretold of him was fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> though it were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to have come to paſs.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be buried is foretold by the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell,</hi> (or, in the grave) <hi>neither wilt thou ſuffer thine holy one to ſee Corruption.</hi> We
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65506:145"/>have no diſpute with the <hi>Jews</hi> about the burial of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> for they who grant that he died will not deny that he was buried; it being the cuſtome of the <hi>Jews</hi> to allow burial to all men, even to the greateſt malefactors whatſoever. [<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. with Act. 2.31. and Chap. 13.35.]</p>
               <p>But it was likewiſe foretold that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (though he were to ſuffer an ignominious death) ſhould be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably buried. This was foretold of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and was eminently fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> it is ſaid that he <hi>was cut off out of the land of the living.</hi> And then it follows. <hi>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, becauſe he had done no violence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any deceit in his mouth.</hi> That is, his enemies deſigned him the burial of a malefactor (and he who dies among ſuch is likely to be buried with them alſo) but the <hi>Meſſias</hi> having done no violence would be reſcued by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and honourably buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: [<hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.9.]</p>
               <p>We have another Eminent prophecy of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which cannot be denyed to belong to him by the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65506:145"/>where among other things it is foretold, that <hi>his reſt ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;</hi> which words may well be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to predict the honourable burial of the <hi>Meſſias; Abravenel,</hi> upon the 53. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> brings theſe words as a proof that what is ſaid (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.9.) <hi>he made his grave with the Wicked,</hi> cannot belong to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid that <hi>his reſt ſhall be glorious:</hi> In which he grants two things; Firſt, that the 11th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is to be underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and we find him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expound it of him: Secondly, that theſe words, <hi>his reſt ſhall be glorious</hi> may well be expounded of the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able burial of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> For elſe what cauſe had he to ſay that theſe words are oppoſite to thoſe if they do not belong to the ſame matter? [<hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.10. <hi>Abravenel,</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.9.)</p>
               <p>And as this <hi>Jew</hi> hath juſtified thoſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who underſtand this place of the burial of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſo it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certain that the place hath been underſtood to belong to this matter by the Ancient Writers of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Vulgar Latin renders theſe words, <hi>his reſt ſhall be glorious, erit ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchrum ejus glorioſum.</hi> And we find
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65506:146"/>the <hi>Greek</hi> interpreters elſewhere render the word <hi>reſt</hi> to this ſenſe,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And this place we find was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the honourable burial of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> by the Ancients.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now ſhew that theſe things were fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Though he were crucified under the <hi>Roman</hi> power, yet was he buried contrary to the cuſtome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who left thoſe that were crucified to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the air, and Voracity of the fowls: Again though <hi>Jeſus</hi> died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two theives and died as a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and though his enemies deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing more but an ignoble grave with the wicked, yet it was brought to paſs by the providence of God, that his dead body was buried with the <hi>rich,</hi> and that great <hi>honour</hi> was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in <hi>his burial.</hi> The body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was begged by a <hi>rich man</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Joſeph,</hi> 'twas lapped in clean li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and laid in his own new Tomb.

                  <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
                  <p>Of the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> That we have ſufficient evidence that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did riſe from the dead. That we have the moſt unexceptionable humane Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. Why the ſame number of men are called the <hi>eleven</hi> and the <hi>twelve</hi> elſewhere, when they were but <hi>Ten?</hi> John <hi>21.14.</hi> Explained. This confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Teſtimony of an <hi>Angel</hi> and by <hi>Divine</hi> Teſtimony. That <hi>Jeſus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all cauſe of doubting of the truth of his Reſurrection: That there were a ſelect number of Men choſen to be witneſſes of the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> That theſe witneſſes, as alſo the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts are worthy of belief. That it was foretold that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould riſe from the dead. The words (Pſ. <hi>11.5.</hi>) <hi>This day have I begotten thee,</hi> are juſtly applyed to this matter: This proved againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> at large. That <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe from the dead is an undeniable proof that he is the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and of the greateſt importance to us.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65506:147"/>Of the time when <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe from the dead. Why on the <hi>third day?</hi> And how he could be ſaid to riſe on the third day who was but one whole day in the Sepulchre; and how this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with Matt. <hi>12.40.</hi> where <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid he ſhould <hi>be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth?</hi> The third day on which <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the firſt day of the Week.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF the <hi>ſufferings and death of Jeſus</hi> will afford us any arguments to prove him to be the <hi>Meſſias; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus</hi> from the dead, and his exaltation to God's right hand will much more afford us pregnant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable proofs that he was the <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Son of God; and that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which he hath taught us came from God. And for the better ſpeaking to this matter I ſhall</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, ſhew that we have ſufficient evidence that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did riſe from the dead.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, that this is an unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proof that he is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, I ſhall conſider the time when <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe from the dead, viz. <hi>the third day.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:65506:148"/>I ſhall ſhew that we have ſufficient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did riſe from the dead. By ſufficient evidence I mean ſuch as is enough to ſatisfie any honeſt and inquiſitive mind; as much, not to ſay much more, as we have for any matter of fact, which we were not the eye-witneſſes of. As much, and more, as we have for other things of the truth of which we neither do, nor can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, make any manner of doubt; as much as we can reaſonably deſire or expect. And what that is we may learn from the following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have the moſt unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able humane Teſtimony that can be deſired, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did riſe from the dead: For we have it from them who ſaw him, and converſed with him, to whom <hi>he ſhewed himſelf alive after his paſſion, by many infallible proofs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen of them forty days.</hi> From them who did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the dead. That there was ſuch a perſons as <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and that he died the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves do not deny. That this <hi>Jeſus</hi> did riſe again we have the greateſt aſſurance from thoſe who ſaw him: [<hi>Act.</hi> 1.3. and ch. 10.41.]</p>
               <p>Firſt, he appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:65506:148"/>and to <hi>other Women:</hi> And this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was his firſt appearance. [<hi>Mark</hi> 16.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.14. <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.9.]</p>
               <p>Secondly, he appeared to <hi>two</hi> of his <hi>Diſciples</hi> going to <hi>Emmaus.</hi> And they were <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Cleophas.</hi> That <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> was the ſame with <hi>Alpheus,</hi> (as may be collected from <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.25. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.56. and <hi>Mark</hi> 15.40.) and this appearance ſeems to be that which the Apoſtle mentions when he ſaith that he was ſeen of <hi>Cephas</hi> (<hi>Luk.</hi> 24.13, 18, 34. 1. Cor. 15.5.)</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he appeared to the <hi>Eleven,</hi> ſo indeed they are called; though it is certain that there were but <hi>ten</hi> of them preſent at that time. For <hi>Thomas</hi> was abſent: And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he was ſeen of the <hi>twelve.</hi> And <hi>Thomas</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one of the <hi>twelve,</hi> when yet the whole number was at that time but <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven.</hi> (<hi>Luk.</hi> 24.33, 36. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.19. <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k</hi> 16.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.24. 1 Cor. 15.5.</p>
               <p>There is no cauſe that any man ſhould upon this account Scoff at the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or call in queſtion their divine authority. Had the Writers of theſe books been evil and crafty men, had
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65506:149"/>they combined together to put a cheat upon the World, they might eaſily have avoided ſuch occaſions of offence. And it is to me no little argument of the truth of what they affirm, that they all agree in the main, and differ at the ſame time in ſome circumſtances of delivering it down to us.</p>
               <p>The difficulty before us is very ſmall. They are called the <hi>twelve,</hi> becauſe that was the full number of the Apoſtles of <hi>Chriſt</hi> before the defection and death of <hi>Judas;</hi> as well as after the <hi>election</hi> of <hi>Matthias:</hi> And nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon than to call a ſociety of men by that number, of which they conſiſt, and by which they are generally called; even when the intire number is not made up: But then they are by the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> called <hi>eleven,</hi> that being the full number when <hi>Judas</hi> was gone off. And <hi>Thomas</hi> may well be ſaid to be one of the <hi>twelve</hi> with reſpect to the full number which was at firſt.</p>
               <p>The Jews of all men have no reaſon upon this account to diſparage the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts,</hi> becauſe they do in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeak after the manner of thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which the <hi>Jews</hi> allow to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. The Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> tell <hi>Joſeph</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:65506:149"/>(when they ſuppoſed him to be dead) that they were <hi>twelve brethren,</hi> when they acknowledge that one was dead: <hi>The youngeſt this day is with our Father, and one is not.</hi> And though they were <hi>eleven</hi> (as they verily beleived) yet they call themſelves the <hi>twelve bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> as they were at firſt. And when the <hi>twelve</hi> Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> are reckoned up, it is ſaid, <hi>theſe are the Sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-Aram.</hi> And yet it is evident that <hi>eleven</hi> onely of the twelve were born there. This may ſeem too great a digreſſion, and therefore I return, and ſhall under this head onely add that all theſe appearances of our Lord happened upon the ſame day that he roſe from the dead (<hi>Gen.</hi> 42.13. and ch. 35.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.24.)</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he appeared to the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples when <hi>Thomas</hi> was with them and this was (as it is very probable) the week after his Reſurrection, and upon the firſt day of the week. Thoſe words in St. <hi>John,</hi> after <hi>eight days</hi> will very well bear this ſenſe. (<hi>Joh.</hi> 20.26.)</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he appears again to ſeven of his diſciples at the Sea of <hi>Tyberias.</hi> The occaſion of their being there ſeems to be this. It is well known that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65506:150"/>had told his diſciples that after his Reſurrection he would go before them into <hi>Galilee.</hi> After <hi>Chriſt</hi> was riſen the Angel bad the women go and tell his diſciples and <hi>Peter</hi> that they ſhould ſee him in <hi>Galilee</hi> as he had ſaid unto them: Accordingly the diſciples go down thither to meet their Lord: while they were there and waited for the appearance of <hi>Jeſus, Peter</hi> and ſix more go a fiſhing, and then <hi>Jeſus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them of which we have a more particular account, <hi>Joh.</hi> ch. 21. With reſpect to this appearance St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>This is now the third time that Jeſus ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to his diſciples after that he was riſen from the dead.</hi> And ſo indeed it was, the <hi>third</hi> time of his appearing to the greater number of his diſciples, though he had appeared before to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> at firſt, and to two of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Cleophas</hi> at another time. So that though I reckon this the fifth appearance of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet it is ſtill but the <hi>third</hi> time which he ſhewed himſelf to the greater number of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples. (<hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. 1. <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.16. <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.32. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.14.)</p>
               <p>Sixthly, our Saviour appeared again to the <hi>eleven</hi> diſciples at the mountain
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65506:150"/>in <hi>Galilee.</hi> This <hi>Galilee</hi> was the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in which he had lived, where he was well known, where he had done many miracles, and whence he had choſen ſeveral if not moſt of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. This was a more ſolemn appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord: It was by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it was foretold before his death, and his followers are reminded of it after his Reſurrection; and it is very probable that at this time it was that he appeared to <hi>five hundred</hi> at once, which will ſtill ſpeak this appearance the more conſpicuous and remarkable. (<hi>Matt.</hi> 28.16, 17.1. Cor. 15.6.)</p>
               <p>Seventhly, He appeared to <hi>James,</hi> and to <hi>all the Apoſtles:</hi> We have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his appearing to all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles upon his aſcending up to Heaven. (1. Cor. 15.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.1.)</p>
               <p>Here are a great number of very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable witneſſes. They were thoſe who knew him before, thoſe who ſaw him and converſed with him: They ſaw him often, and a great number they were that did ſo: It is not onely repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a few terrified Women, or a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick follower or two, but all his Apoſtles who had converſed with him for a conſiderable time, and many others
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65506:151"/>who knew him well bear witneſs to this truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have alſo the Teſtimony of an <hi>Angel,</hi> who told the Women that ſought the body of <hi>Jeſus, He is not here, for he is riſen:</hi> Nor is it one Angel one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but two as appears from the other Evangeliſts. Theſe Angels, who are not ſent upon mean and inconſiderable employments, attend upon, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and do alſo ſecure the empty Sepulchre from the <hi>Jews</hi> that they are not able to place another body in the room of that of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> which was riſen (<hi>Matt.</hi> 28.6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.2. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.12.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have a <hi>divine Teſtimony,</hi> and that a moſt irrefragable one; a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony greater than that of men and Angels. Our Lord had promiſed the Holy Spirit, who ſhould be with reſpect to his diſciples a <hi>Comforter,</hi> and with reſpect to our Lord himſelf an <hi>Advocate</hi> to plead his cauſe, and defend his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: Now this promiſe is fulfilled, and this holy Ghoſt did bear witneſs to the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> After <hi>Jeſus</hi> was riſen he breathed on his diſciples and ſaid <hi>receive ye the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and after his Aſcenſion at the day of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:65506:151"/>we find the Holy Ghoſt more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully beſtowed on his Diſciples. And from thence the Apoſtle argues againſt them who derided them, as thoſe who were full of new Wine, that God had raiſed up <hi>Jeſus, who being exalted had ſhed forth this which they now ſaw and heard;</hi> and afterwards concludes, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all the Houſe of Iſrael know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly that God hath made the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> The effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt was a witneſs of the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> And this Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt: was a divine one; it was from Heaven. St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the <hi>Jews</hi> that God had <hi>raiſed up Jeſus, and exalted him at his right hand; and</hi> (ſays he) <hi>we are witneſſes of theſe things, ſo is alſo the Holy Ghoſt whom God hath given to them that obey him.</hi> [Joh. 14.16. ch. 16.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. ch. 20.22. Act. 2.4, 36, ch. 5.32.]</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeſus</hi> did after his reſurrection take away all cauſe of doubt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the truth of his Reſurrection. He gave ſufficient proof that the very ſame body which was faſtened to the Croſs, dyed there, and was buried, was raiſed again to life. The Diſciples were at firſt affrighted and ſuppoſed that they
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65506:152"/>had ſeen a Spirit: But our Saviour put them out of all doubt; <hi>Behold</hi> (ſays he) <hi>my hands and my feet. Handle me, and ſee; for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye ſee me have.</hi> He ſhews his hands and his feet: And whereas at his firſt appearing to his Diſciples, <hi>Thomas</hi> was abſent, and did not believe that he was riſen from the dead, and ſaid more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thruſt my hard into his ſide I will not beleive;</hi> our Lord convinced this doubting Diſciple, and gives him the utmoſt evidence and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the truth of his Reſurrection. <hi>Reach hither thy finger</hi> (ſays <hi>Jeſus</hi> to <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>) <hi>and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand and thruſt it into my ſide; and be not faithleſs but beleiving;</hi> upon which <hi>Thomas</hi> was convinced and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to cry out, my <hi>Lord and my God.</hi> Our Lord gave his followers inſallible proofs of his Reſurrection, in the ſpace of <hi>forty days.</hi> He are and drank with them, expoſed his body to their view and touch, <hi>behold</hi> (ſays he) <hi>my h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. That the truth of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was abundantly confirmed by thoſe who were the witneſſes of it. So it was (and it was highly fit it ſhould be ſo) that there were a <hi>ſelect number</hi> of men who were to be the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> theſe were men whom God had appointed and ſet apart for this purpoſe, and ſuch who upon the account of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and their readineſs to part with all for the ſake of the truth, were ſitted and diſpoſed for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us. <hi>Him God raiſed up the third day and ſhewed him openly, not to all the people but to witneſſes, choſen before of God, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us who did eat and drink with him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he roſe from the dead.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were now the <hi>witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> this they preach and teſtifie upon all occaſions, and this is their <hi>Character</hi> and their Office; [<hi>Act.</hi> 10.41. chap. 1.22. and ch. 3.15. and chap. 4.2, 33. ch. 5.30, 32. ch. 10.30,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65506:153"/>31. ch. 13.31. chap. 17.18.]</p>
               <p>Now theſe witneſſes did abundantly confirm the truth of this Doctrine, which they preached every where, both by <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>wonders</hi> which God wrought by their hands; and by an <hi>exemplary</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> life. And at laſt by <hi>laying down</hi> their <hi>lives</hi> in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Doctrine. Upon which account they were witneſſes beyond all exception. For we cannot beleive that men would part with their lives in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of a lye; or that God would aſſiſt them to do miracles for ſo vile and baſe an end and purpoſe; and they muſt be very profligate wretches who would affirm a matter of fact of which they had not good aſſurance.</p>
               <p>The Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a truth of the greateſt moment and conſequence whatſoever; upon the truth of this our hope, and all our Religion does depend. It was fit that this truth ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently atteſted by perſons of undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted credit. The death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was publick, the whole multitude were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his Crucifixion. But they were not vouchſafed the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the witneſſes of his Reſurrection; the truth of his Reſurrection was too va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65506:153"/>to be concredited to an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and malicious rabble: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God who raiſed up <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>ſhewed him openly</hi> (or gave him to be made manifeſt, as the Greek hath it) did not do it to all the people but to certain ſelect and choſen witneſſes: Theſe men who converſed with him before his death and after his Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who had known his life, and heard his Sermons, and been taught by him before that he muſt dye and riſe again; theſe men who had power to confirm this truth with Miracles, and were prepared to confirm it with their bloud, and did perſiſt in it to their laſt breath were witneſſes indeed beyond all manner of exception.</p>
               <p>I ſay beyond all exception; for there can be no reaſonable exception brought againſt them: And if we will give our ſelves the leiſure to conſider the thing before us, with due application, we ſhall find no cauſe to except. For if there were any ſuch thing it muſt be becauſe of the thing it ſelf, or matter of fact which is atteſted, or the perſons who do report it.</p>
               <p>For the thing it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that God raiſed up <hi>Jeſus,</hi> there lies no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65506:154"/>of reaſonable exception againſt it. For that a man ſhould be raiſed from the dead implyes no contradiction ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>natural.</hi> He that beleives that God made the World cannot think it impoſſible to him to raiſe a dead man to life again:<note place="margin">Multò mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus eſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituere quod fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit quàm facerequod non fuit. <hi>Hieron.</hi> ad <hi>Pamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium.</hi>
                  </note> It is not incredible that he ſhould raiſe a dead man to life, who made all things out of nothing. Nor does it impeach any of the divine perfections to affirm that God raiſed <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to life. No man can reaſonably upon this account think meanly of the divine Being. Upon the whole there is nothing in the thing reported repugnant to right reaſon, nothing unbecoming the divine purity and perfections, nothing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to them that are wiſe and good.</p>
               <p>For the perſons who report this, if there lye any exception againſt them, it muſt be upon the ſcore of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or wilfullneſs.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps be pretended that they were weak men and impoſed upon: That they took up this beleif that <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe from the dead upon light and inſufficient grounds, and though they did not contrive to deceive others yet they themſelves were eaſily deceived.</p>
               <p>But this cannot be pretended with
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65506:154"/>any reaſon at all: For they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was raiſed to life upon hear-ſay or common fame; they did not receive it as a tradition received from others: But they were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of it. They were men that knew <hi>Jeſus</hi> before he died, that converſed with him <hi>forty days</hi> after he roſe from the dead, that had ſometimes doubted of the truth of his Reſurrection them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and had received the utmoſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that it was that <hi>Jeſus</hi> who died, that was riſen from the dead; and when they were aſſured of it they taught this doctrine boldly; and they taught no more than what they knew to be true; what they had <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>handled</hi> that they taught. Nor did this depend upon the Teſtimony of Women or Children or any incompetent witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; or upon a bare and ſingle Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: But a number of men, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent witneſſes imaginable, did upon all occaſions affirm that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was riſen from the dead. There were no leſs than <hi>twelve</hi> principal witneſſes of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, beſides the many others who ſaw <hi>Jeſus</hi> after he was riſen. [<hi>Act.</hi> 1.21, 22.]</p>
               <p>Nor can we think that theſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did <hi>wilfully</hi> go about to lye and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65506:155"/>put a cheat upon other men: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think them ſuch vile perſons, or that they could have prevailed this way.</p>
               <p>For beſides that they taught other men to ſpeak the truth, and that they are not accuſed otherwiſe as flagitious perſons, to what purpoſe ſhould they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was riſen from the dead if it were falſe? Could they get any thing by ſuch a lye? Was it a ſtep to any honour or preferment to ſay that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was raiſed to life again? Was this Doctrine pleaſing to the <hi>Jews?</hi> Would it procure them any favour from the <hi>Gentile</hi> World? Nay is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that for affirming this the <hi>Jews</hi> who put <hi>Jeſus</hi> to death were enraged againſt them? For they arraigned the Juſtice of their Nation, and incenſed their <hi>Countrey men</hi> to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree whatſoever. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſcoffed at them and derided them, and their ſcoffs were the leaſt Evils they ſuffered upon this account; for they continued in this their Teſtimony under torments and even unto death.</p>
               <p>Can any man imagine that this was a contrivance and Plot of crafty men? That they combined to put a cheat upon mankind? but to what end ſhould
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65506:155"/>they do this? It is not likely they could engage a conſiderable number in ſuch a combination. It would be hard to find a great many men ſo weary of their lives as to be content to throw them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in confirmation of a lye. Beſides the fraud would have been diſcover'd quickly: For theſe men did not forbear to tell when and where this happened which they were the witneſſes of.</p>
               <p>Did ever any men of credit prove theſe witneſſes incompetent? Did they ever deprehend them in a lye or ſpeaking inconſiſtently? Did it appear at any time that they were caught in a falſe ſtory, or that any one of them were forced to recant and retract what he had ſaid?</p>
               <p>How came this beleif to ſpread ſo quickly in the world if it had not been true? Could it have any thing elſe to recommend it to the belief of mankind? That it quickly gained an Univerſal belief in the world is undeniable; but how could this be? God atteſted to this truth by enabling theſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to work miracles in confirmation of it. That ſo it was no man can doubt that gives any credit to the Teſtimony of others. Had it not been ſo the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65506:156"/>of this beleif, without a miracle, would have been the greateſt miracle of all.</p>
               <p>It is plain that we have no reaſon to doubt of the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> There is no Hiſtory, no matter of fact, which yet we beleive firmly, that we have that cauſe to beleive as we have this, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was raiſed from the dead; and therefore if we do not beleive that <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe from the dead, it is not from want of evidence, and ſufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of credibility, but from a faulty principle, and a culpable neglect of ſeeking after the truth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Evangeliſts who report the matter of fact, concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> are worthy of all credit. For their names are annexed to their writings, they ſet down the time and place where thoſe things happened which they write of; they name the perſons concerned in theſe things; they write of things which happened in their own time, and which they knew to be true. They all agree in the main ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and their different relating of ſome ſmaller circumſtances does but confirm their credit as to the main relation. What can we deſire in any writing which
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65506:156"/>is wanting here? What have we to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt theſe writers? Can we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they did conſpire to put a cheat upon mankind? But what reaſon have we for this ſuſpicion? Surely none, but much to the contrary.</p>
               <p>For they do not write like men who had combined together to cheat the world. For they own their names, they relate ſomething with ſome ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming difference, they mention the time and place where thoſe things happened, which they write; they name many perſons and of ſeveral Nations and ranks that were concerned, they ſtick not to mention their own meanneſs and their own faults and infirmities, and the ſhame and death of their great Lord and Maſter.</p>
               <p>Nor could theſe or the other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Reſurrection be induced by any worldly Temptation to tell a lye. They did beleive the Religion which they profeſſed, or they did not. If they did beleive it they durſt not tell a lye, that being directly forbid in that Religion which they beleived to be true. If they did not beleive it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; what could perſwade them to obtrude the belief of it upon other men? They were ſo far from gaining by this
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65506:157"/>courſe that they expoſed themſelves to the malice and rage of men, to the loſs of all things, and the ſevereſt death. Can we believe that they ſhould be ſo fond of what they knew to be a lie, that they would loſe all they had in confirmation of it? Men are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo fond of truth as to confirm it with their bloud: Can we imagine that men ſhould perſiſt in a lie to the loſs of all things?<note place="margin">At the cloſe of chap.

               <p n="7">7. That the Reſurrection of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> was <hi>foretold</hi> in the old Teſtament, as well as <hi>typified;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> are not to be rejected by the <hi>Jews</hi> for reporting this matter.

               <p>But we have another prediction of the Reſurrection of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belong to the perſon of <hi>David</hi> at all; viz. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell: neither wilt thou ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> This muſt belong to the perſon of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> for <hi>David</hi> dyed and was buried, and his fleſh conſumed; and it is therefore an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable proof of that truth which it is brought to Confirm.

               <p>We have another Prophecy that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſhall dye no more, viz. <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the ſure mercies of God,</hi> which we find the Apoſtle applying to this matter, and inferring from it that <hi>Chriſt</hi> who roſe from the dead, <hi>was no more to return to corruption.</hi> [<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.34.]</p>
               <p>If what hath been ſaid be duly conſidered we ſhall find that God hath
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65506:160"/>given us ſufficient aſſurance that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> did riſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>For what greater aſſurrance can we deſire of this matter of fact, unleſs we think Our Saviour ſhould have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every age, and Country, and riſen again to ſatisfie our unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble infidelity?</p>
               <p>What is there that the <hi>Jew</hi> can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt this doctrine thus confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? will they undertake to prove a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative againſt ſo many poſitive proofs and witneſſes? what poſſible ways are there left them of doing this? They cannot deny the poſſibility of the thing, who believe a Reſurrection to come, or that God made the world: Or will they ſay as once they did, who watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Sepulchre, and were hired to ſay it, that his <hi>Diſciples came by night and ſtole him away while they ſlept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it probable, that this ſhould gain any belief among men? what temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could they have to do this? Or is it likely that they, who for fear forſook him when he was living, ſhould adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the Guard to retrieve his dead body, which was honourably interred? If theſe Souldiers knew this to be true, why did they not hinder it? if they knew
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65506:161"/>it not how could they Teſtify? what could hinder them who had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that they did not prevent it? Or what reaſon have we to believe thoſe Competent witneſſes who confeſs that they were a ſleep when it was done?</p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewed that we have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Evidence that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did riſe from the dead, I ſhall now proceed to ſhew,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> That this is an unexceptionable proof that he is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the truth of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>I need not enlarge upon this head. For it is very evident and plain, and the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves cannot deny it. And for that reaſon they who deny not that he lived and dyed, do what they can to ſtifle the belief of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. This they do becauſe they are ſenſible that his Reſurrection from the dead is a proof beyond exception that he is the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> They Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured what they could to hinder his reſurrection, and when they could not doe that, they laboured to hinder the belief of it.</p>
               <p>And that which makes the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſo unexceptionable a proof that he is the <hi>Chriſt</hi> is this, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65506:161"/>in his life time, not onely profeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Son of God, but alſo foretell the manner of his own death, and that he ſhould not onely riſe again, but riſe again the third day; and does referr the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> to his Reſurrection, as to the great ſign and proof of his being ſent from God. When the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> asked <hi>Jeſus</hi> for a ſign, He anſwered and ſaid unto them; <hi>an Evil and adulterous genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeeketh after a Sign, and there ſhall no ſign be given to it, but the ſign of the Prophet</hi> Jonas. <hi>For as</hi> Jonas <hi>was three days and three nights in the Whales bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo ſhall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth.</hi> Our Lord had done many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous works among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſtill they require a Sign, or a more plain and clear proof that he came from God; Our Saviour referrs them to his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection as that which would be a moſt unexceptionable one, and ſufficient to remove any but a perverſe and incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unbelief. And this he calls the Sign of the Prophet <hi>Jonas:</hi> That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was ſent to call the <hi>Ninevites</hi> to repentance, and was ſucceſsfull in his undertaking; and his miraculous eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65506:162"/>from the belly of the Whale was a Competent proof that he was ſent by God, and very fit to gain him credit with the <hi>Ninevites;</hi> And very probable it is, that the fame of what had befallen the Prophet had come to the men of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi> and that it made way for the reception of the doctrine which he preached. The Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a greater ſign, and that which made way for the Entertainment of his doctrine in the World; For it did confirm the truth of his Doctrine. [<hi>Matt.</hi> 16.21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. ch. 3.14. ch. 12.32, 33. <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.39, 40.]</p>
               <p>There have been thoſe who have been raiſed from the dead beſides <hi>Jeſus:</hi> And many beſides him have profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo. But none in the world but <hi>Jeſus</hi> profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and confirmed it by his Reſurrection.<note place="margin">Maimon. <hi>Epiſt. ad</hi> Judaeos Marſilien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> 
                  <hi>Maimon</hi> tells us of one who deceived the poor <hi>Jews</hi> under a pretence that he was at leaſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who having boaſted vainly that he would riſe again after his death, in token that he came from God, was indeed beheaded by a certain <hi>Arabian</hi> King, but returned not to life again. He was not able to give
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:65506:162"/>the proof that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did who roſe from the dead. And though there have been others who have been raiſed from the dead, yet none of them ever profeſſed to be the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Son of the living God, as our <hi>Jeſus</hi> did.</p>
               <p>This being a truth upon which the truth of the whole Chriſtian Religion depends, no wonder that the belief of this Article ſhould be accounted for a faith in the whole Religion. <hi>That is the word of faith</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>which we preach, that if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in thine heart, that God hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead thou ſhalt be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> For he that believes that <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe from the dead, does believe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles of Religion which are all confirmed by this. He that believes that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is riſen, does at the ſame time believe him to be the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that his precepts are divine, that his promiſes are certain, and his power and authority uncontrollable. This is indeed the faith peculiar to <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians:</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Heathens</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſome other points relating to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; That <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe, that he is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Son of God, this is the great
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65506:163"/>Article of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith: Hence it is that ſo much is imputed to this faith, and to the confeſſion of this truth in the New Teſtament. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in God.</hi> And afterward, <hi>whoſoever believeth that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Chriſt, is born of God.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believed this believed all the Chriſtian Religion, and he that (when thoſe words were written) did believe and profeſs this truth, when 'twas great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous ſo to doe, as he gave proof of a ſincere faith, ſo he might be truly ſaid to dwell in God and to be born of God. [<hi>Ro.</hi> 10.9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.15. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1.]</p>
               <p>Had not <hi>Chriſt</hi> been a man he could not have died, and had he not been <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Son of God he could not have riſen from the dead. Had <hi>Jeſus</hi> been a deceiver he muſt have lain in the grave till the general Reſurrection: Nothing leſs than a divine power could raiſe him to life again; it was the Godhead which raiſed the humane nature; and then <hi>Chriſt</hi> raiſed himſelf as he foretold he would, and gave a great proof of his Divinity. [<hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19, 21.]</p>
               <p>It is an eaſie thing to deſtroy life but
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65506:163"/>to reſtore it again ſpeaks an almighty power: It is nothing ſhort of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence which can bring ſo great a thing to paſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Key</hi> of the <hi>grave</hi> is one of thoſe which God keeps in his own hand.

               <p>It is certain that there could be but one whole day and two nights between the death of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Reſurrection, and yet <hi>Jeſus</hi> had foretold that the Son of man ſhould <hi>be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth:</hi> Again, he ſaid, <hi>after three days I will riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> and, <hi>deſtroy this Temple,</hi> and <hi>after three days I will raiſe it up.</hi> And

We have a remarkable inſtance to this purpoſe. <hi>It came to paſs in the fourth year of King Hezekiah (which was the ſeventh year of Hoſhea Son of Ela, King of Iſrael) that Shalmaneſer King of Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria came up againſt Samaria and beſieged it.

                  <item>Secondly, that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> did aſcend into Heaven, and is there concerned on the behalf of his people.</item>

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65506:169"/>infer this truth from the avowed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, I ſhall make it appear from the effects following upon the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in Heaven that he did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend thither, and was there concerned on our behalf, and that therefore our <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>This was foretold in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high: thou haſt led captivity captive: thou haſt received gifts for men:</hi> Pſalm 68.18. Theſe words are not onely applied by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.8.</note> but with great reaſon they are ſo applied. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that <hi>Pſalm</hi> was the removal of the Ark,<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.1. 1 Chron. 13.5.</note> which of a long time had been ſeparated from the Tabernacle of the congregation which <hi>Moſes</hi> had made for it.

And therefore it ſhall not need to ſeem ſtrange to any man, that thoſe words which were at
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65506:169"/>firſt uſed with reference to the Ark, ſhould be applied to the aſcenſion of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And this may be the more reaſonably preſumed to be implied in thoſe words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with the words of another Pſalm relating to this matter;<note place="margin">Pſal. 24.</note> where we find the Ark, the ſymbol of God's ſpecial preſence, called the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and it's reception into the place prepared for it, repreſented in ſuch words as do ſerve to expreſs the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a glorious King into his Palace and Throne. <hi>Lift up your heads,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Beſides what hath been ſaid, to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Apoſtle's application of thoſe words to the Aſcenſion of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> into Heaven, I may add farther that the words themſelves cannot ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be applied to any perſon as to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> when he did aſcend up into Heaven:<note place="margin">Pſal. 7.8.93.4.71.19.</note> For what we render <hi>on high</hi> is obſerved in the Pſalmiſt's phraſe to ſignifie Heaven, and to be applied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. And the following words, <hi>thou haſt led Captivity Captive,</hi> &amp;c. do
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:65506:170"/>very fitly agree with the conqueſt which <hi>Chriſt</hi> obtained over death, and over the Devil whom he triumphantly led Captive when he went up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and he did (as thoſe who trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed were wont to doe) upon this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of his into Heaven beſtow great gifts upon mankind; the beſtowing of which was an argument that when he was exalted into Heaven himſelf he did not forget his followers, but did by the gifts which he beſtowed make it appear that he was concerned there in behalf of his people.</p>
               <p>Another prophecy to this purpoſe we find in <hi>Micah.</hi>

                  <hi>The breaker is come up before them: They have broken up, and have paſſed through the gate, and are gone out by it, and their King ſhall paſs before them, and the Lord on the head of them.</hi> I will by no means enter into a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular explication of this place,<note place="margin">

               <p>I ſhall name but one more, but that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65506:170"/>is a very eminent and conſpicuous one. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>ſit thou at my right hand, untill I make thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies thy footſtool.</hi> Now theſe words do ſo belong to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applied to any other perſon. And whereas ſeveral predictions which concern the <hi>Meſſias</hi> had alſo a reference firſt to ſome other eminent perſon, who was a type of him: The words of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> throughout do immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him, and cannot in any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſenſe be applied to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>David, Ezekiah,</hi> or <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon whatſoever.

                  </note> yet as they have been very unhappy in it, ſo ſeveral of them have been forced to confeſs that theſe words are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And without all doubt the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> did with one conſent interpret this <hi>Pſalm</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who is ſaid not onely to ſit at God's right hand, but alſo to be a Prieſt for ever after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> which words can not be with truth affirmed of any other perſon whatſoever.

If David then call him Lord, how is he his Son?</hi> This put them to ſilence, which it would not have done if theſe words had not been confeſſed to belong to the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> Had it not been the ſenſe of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Pſalm belongs to him, they could ſoon have anſwered our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this place: And as this place was made uſe of by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſo it was by his followers alſo to the ſame purpoſe and to the ſame perſons (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi>) alſo.<note place="margin">Act. 2.34.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells them that <hi>David is not aſcended into the heavens:</hi> but he ſaith himſelf, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou on my right hand,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Now this ſitting on the right hand of God does denote the exaltation of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and not onely that but his great power and authority, and his being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned as Kings and Prieſts are for their people, whom they govern or for whom they intercede.

And as the moſt holy place in the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary was, of all others whatſoever, whether in the Sanctuary or elſewhere, the moſt ſeparate and holy place, ſo it is but reaſonable to ſuppoſe that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſcended into Heaven, he did not take up in any of the lower parts
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:65506:172"/>of Heaven, but was exalted to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them all. The Sanctuary was divided into three parts: The Courts, the holy place, and the moſt holy; each of theſe are frequently called the Sanctuary or the Temple, though the third of theſe were the moſt holy place.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Air, and the place of Planets and Stars are called Heaven; and yet there is a third or higher Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into which St. <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up, and into which our Lord entred.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour is ſaid to be received up <hi>into glory,</hi> i. e. into the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Anti-type of that holy place, where God did more eſpecially preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate himſelf, and where the Ark ſtood, the ſymbol of his preſence, and which was called the <hi>Glory. Jeſus</hi> is elſewhere ſaid to have <hi>paſſed through the Heavens,</hi> and to be <hi>made higher than the Heavens,</hi> and to have <hi>aſcended up far above all Heavens,</hi> and to be <hi>entred into that within the veil.</hi> And as he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf greatly, ſo God highly exalted him, and ſet him <hi>at his own right hand in the Heavenly places, far above all princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, and power, and might, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and every name that is named:</hi> [1 Tim. 3.16. 1 Sam. 4.22. <hi>with</hi> Rom. 9.4.
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:65506:173"/>Heb. 4.14.9.5.7.26. Eph. 4.10. Heb. 6.19. Philip. 2.9. Eph. 1.20, 21.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Jeſus</hi> did aſcend into Heaven is plainly taught,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.51. Act. 1.9, 10.</note> and there were eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes of it: His Diſciples ſtood by when he went up into Heaven: They did not doe ſo when he roſe from the dead. Not that his Reſurrection did not need atteſtation as much as his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into Heaven. His followers had need be aſſured of the truth of that, and indeed they had the utmoſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and did upon all occaſions bear witneſs to it, and were particularly the witneſſes of his Reſurrection. But in order to their being ſo, it was not needfull that they ſhould be the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes thereof, as they were, and indeed ought to be (before they could be competent witneſſes of it) of his Aſcenſion into Heaven. It was enough to make them competent witneſſes of his Reſurrection that they ſaw him that was riſen, they need not ſee him riſe. For it being certain (and granted ſo to be, even by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves) that he died, it was not needfull that they ſhould ſee him riſe from the dead; it was enough if they ſaw him, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, alive again. But then he aſcended
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65506:173"/>in the view of his Diſciples, and 'twas in this caſe needfull that there ſhould be eye-witneſſes; and ſo it was that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be wanting to the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our faith.</p>
               <p>And as we are by eye-witneſſes aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Aſcenſion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo thoſe witneſſes were unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable alſo. For beſides that they knew his perſon, and had of a long time converſed with him, ſo they had done it a competent time after his Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the dead:<note place="margin">Act. 1.3.</note>

               <p>And this diſtance of forty days which were between his reſurrection and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion to heaven,<note place="margin">Act. 13.31. Luk. 2.21, 22. <hi>with</hi> Levit. 12.2, 4.</note> is the very ſame ſpace of time which did intervene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his birth of the Virgin, and his being preſented (according to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>) in the Temple. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was twice born, and twice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented: He was <hi>born</hi> of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and <hi>raiſed</hi> out of the <hi>grave:</hi> And he
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65506:174"/>was twice preſented too, firſt at the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and afterwards at the Temple <hi>above,</hi> or Heaven. And forty days after each birth he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented: After the firſt in the Temple below, after the ſecond in Heaven, or the Temple above, the Anti-type of that which was made with hands.</p>
               <p>Juſt ſo many days did he continue upon earth after his Reſurrection, as <hi>Jonas</hi> who was a type of him allowed the <hi>Ninevites</hi> to repent in. So exactly did he anſwer the type. The <hi>Jews</hi> had the ſign of the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days, though they repented not as the <hi>Ninevites</hi> did. Again, they were allowed a year for a day likewiſe from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection to the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Such was the Lenity of God, ſo great his forbearance. Their Forefathers wandred forty years in the Wilderneſs for their Rebellion; God allowed the <hi>Jews</hi> the ſame time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. But this will be thought too great a digreſſion.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Jeſus</hi> is entred <hi>within the Veil,</hi> ſo he is for us entred alſo, as our high Prieſt and Patron with God. And as his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> was not <hi>figurative,</hi> and <hi>metaphorical</hi> but <hi>real,</hi> ſo is his <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:65506:174"/>He is now concerned for us there; <hi>He ever lives to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for thoſe who come unto God by him.</hi> Again, <hi>who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> Again, <hi>if any man ſin we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> Again, <hi>he appears in the preſence of God for us.</hi> [Heb. 7.25. Rom. 8.35. 1 Joh. 2. 1. Heb. 9.24.] After this manner is that care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern expreſſed which <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath for his followers.</p>
               <p>Shall he after all this be called a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical</hi> Prieſt onely?<note place="margin">Heb. 8.2.</note> Shall he that is the Miniſter of the <hi>true</hi> Tabernacle be himſelf but <hi>improperly</hi> a Prieſt? ſhall <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>type</hi> be <hi>truly</hi> a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and ſhall the <hi>Anti-type</hi> be one <hi>improperly</hi> ſo called? Can any thing be ſaid by the followers of <hi>Socinus</hi> upon weaker grounds than this? There need to have been no change of the Law, if the change of the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> had onely been into that which is <hi>figurative.</hi>

                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> might have been a <hi>Metaphorical Prieſt</hi> upon <hi>earth,</hi> and very conſiſtently with the order of <hi>Aaron.</hi> What need had
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65506:175"/>this High Prieſt (as well as thoſe of the order of <hi>Aaron</hi>) to have ſomething to offer if he had been onely <hi>Tanquam Pontifex,</hi>

Shall the High Prieſt of this order of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> not deſerve this name which was juſtly due to the Sons of <hi>Aaron?</hi> And the Anti-type be leſs real than the Type is?</p>
               <p>It is evident that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is a Prieſt of the higheſt order, and nothing is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſpeak him ſo in the moſt perfect ſenſe.

               <p>From what hath been ſaid it appears that the Holy of Holies (in the ſenſe of the learned among the <hi>Jews</hi>) was a type of the higheſt Heavens into which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is entred: And this being ſo great a truth, and ſo Univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the Sanctuary below was a ſign or type of that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, it is not ſtrange that it ſhould be put for it. It being very uſual to put the ſign for the thing, ſignified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. Thus, ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The Lord is in his holy Temple,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.20.9.23.</note> and we are ſaid to have <hi>a liberty of entring into the holieſt,</hi> by which Heaven is meant, the type being put for the anti-type.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:65506:181"/>I ſhall take this occaſion to give ſome account of a paſſage in <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to my preſent argument: He tells us that upon the death of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>veil of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 27.51.</note> This is a particular that requires a diſtinct conſideration: This rupture of the veil not being the effect of the earth-quake mentioned in the next words; for then it would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been rent from the bottom to the top; it not being reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that a rent from the top to the bottom ſhould be the conſequent and effect of an earth-quake or renting of the Rocks. And for that reaſon I ſuppoſe it mentioned here before the mention of the earth-quake and renting the Rocks, as that which was not the effect of them, and was of a ſeparate conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration from them.</p>
               <p>It will be worth our while to inquire what veil it was that was rent, and what the renting of it did import, and by that time I have done this it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that this paſſage hath a relation to the argument I am now upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maimon</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Maimon. Beth Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bechirah. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> that in the firſt Temple there was a Wall between the holy and the moſt holy place, of the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65506:182"/>thickneſs of a Cubit: and that when they built the ſecond Temple there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe a doubt among the builders, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſpace that this Wall took up were to be allowed out of the holy or moſt holy place; and that for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they left a ſpace between the one and the other of the extent of a Cubit and built no Wall, but inſtead of that they made two Veils one towards the Holy of Holies and the other towards the holy place, leaving a ſpace between them of the thickneſs of a Cubit, where the Wall was ſuppoſed to ſtand in the Temple of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Of this partition between the Holy and Holy of Holies the words of the Evangeliſt are to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>There were indeed two Veils in the Sanctuary: One at the entring into the holy place: <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.37. Another which divided the holy from the moſt holy place. <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.35. Which is called the ſecond <hi>Veil,</hi> Heb. 9.3. And that the words of the Evangeliſt are to be underſtood of this ſecond Veil is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from the words themſelves: For he uſes the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which is the very word the LXXII make uſe of, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.35. Where that Veil is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,

               </p>
               <p>It will not be hard to underſtand what this imported.

               <p>The firſt is the miraculous deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt at the day of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt.</hi> (Act. 2.) Our Saviour had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his ſorrowfull Diſciples a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter who ſhould abide with them for ever.

(<hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 18. ch. 15. <hi>v.</hi> 26. and ch. 16. <hi>v.</hi> 7.) He repeated this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe after his Reſurrection. (<hi>Luk.</hi> 24.49.) And before his Aſcenſion he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them that <hi>they ſhould not depart from Jeruſalem, but wait for the promiſe of the Father, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye have heard of me.</hi> (Act. 1.4.)

To the great amazement of the multitude which from ſeveral nations were come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the feaſt of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt which was then miraculouſly beſtowed upon the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was his Advocate and pleaded his cauſe: Our Saviour had
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65506:183"/>foretold that he would bear witneſs of him. And this the Holy Ghoſt did.<note place="margin">Joh. 15.26.</note>

                  <item>(1.) As he teſtified that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a true Prophet, when he promiſed this heavenly gift to his diſciples, and did thereby bear Teſtimony to his veracity, and make it appear that he was not an impoſtor or cheat. They were now convinced abundantly that <hi>Jeſus</hi> had made his word good. (<hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7, 10.) And now there was no ſuſpicion left of his being a falſe Prophet or deceiver.</item>
                  <item>(2.) Of the power and autority which <hi>Jeſus</hi> had. He told his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that all power was given him in Heaven and Earth (<hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18.) This he told them after his Reſurrection and a little before his Aſcenſion into Heaven: He gave at the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable proof of it. <hi>Jeſus</hi> had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death to the elders and chief Prieſts and Scribes, that asked him if he were the <hi>Chriſt, Hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Son of man ſit on the right hand of the power of God,</hi> (Luk. 22.69.) The meaning of which words is plainly this, that they ſhould be convinced e'er long of his great power which he had in Heaven upon his exaltation to that place, and at the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> he
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:65506:184"/>gave a great demonſtration of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> does conclude from it that he is the <hi>Chriſt. This Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath God raiſed up, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are all witneſſes. Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this which ye now ſee and hear.</hi> And preſently afterward he concludes, as he very juſtly might do, <hi>Therefore let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus whom ye have Crucified both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> (Act. 2. v. 32, 33, 36.)</item>

               <p>Secondly, another great effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the exaltation of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the ſucceſs of his Religion in the world, which was a farther argument of the power of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in Heaven, and of his being concerned for his Church, and an evident proof that this <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But for the better ſpeaking to this I ſhall ſhew,</p>

                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:65506:184"/>Thirdly, that this ſucceſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is an unexceptionable proof that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

To which we may add <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. as alſo what he tells us afterwards, <hi>The Gentiles ſhall come to thy light, and King's to the brightneſs of thy riſing— The abundance of the Sea ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to thee, the forces of the Gentiles ſhall come unto thee,</hi> c. 60.3, 5. We ſhall hear what the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> alſo tells us. <hi>I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy, and I will ſay to them which were not my people, thou art my people,</hi> Hoſ. 2.23. No leſs perhaps is meant than this in that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Zechary,</hi> where <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is not permitted to come under a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring line, and that becauſe ſhe <hi>ſhould be inhabited as Towns without walls for the multitude of men and Cattel therein,</hi> Zech. 2.4. However, ſure I am that the ſame Prophet ſpeaks plainly in theſe
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:65506:185"/>words: <hi>Many people and ſtrong nations ſhall come to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts in Jeruſalem, and to pray before the Lord,</hi> c. 8.22. And as plainly ſtill afterwards in theſe words. <hi>Rejoyce greatly O daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion; ſhout O daughter of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; Behold thy King cometh unto thee; he is juſt and having Salvation, lowly and riding upon an Aſſe, and upon a colt the foal of an Aſſe: And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horſe from Jeruſalem, and the battel bow ſhall be cut off; and he ſhall ſpeak peace unto the Heathen: And his Dominion ſhall be from Sea even to Sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth,</hi> c. 9. v. 4, 10. To which I ſhall add the words of the Prophet <hi>Malachy. From the riſing of the Sun unto the going down of the ſame my name ſhall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incenſe ſhall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name ſhall be great among the Heathen, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Mal. 1.11. By which we may ſee that the Gentiles according to theſe prophecies were to ſubmit to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and to be taken into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which becauſe it could not be unleſs they forſook their
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65506:186"/>Idolatry we find the Prophets foretell alſo that they ſhould put away their Idols. Thus the Prophet aſſures us. <hi>And the Idols he ſhall utterly aboliſh: In that day a man ſhall caſt his Idols of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and his Idols of Gold, which they have made each one for himſelf to worſhip, to the Moles, and to the Bats,</hi> Iſa. 2.18, 20. And another Prophet tells us. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in that day, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, that I will cut off the names of the Idols out of the Land, and they ſhall be no more remembred,</hi> Zech. 13.2. Theſe are very plain words as can be: So that it muſt be in the days of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that the Gentiles ſhould no longer be ſtrangers and aliens from the covenant of grace. This difference between Jew and Gentile is now to be removed. God will not onely be known in <hi>Judah</hi> but among all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth.</p>

Now if theſe prophecies are already in great meaſure fulfilled, then is this <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> That they were in great meaſure fulfilled is very evident: For though <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and died in <hi>Jewry,</hi> yet did not his Doctrine ſtay there. There he lived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but yet in <hi>Galilee</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not far off from the poor <hi>Gentiles</hi> whom he came to ſave alſo. He tells the <hi>Jews</hi> no leſs: <hi>I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me,</hi> Joh. 12.32. That is, after his death his Doctrine ſhould greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon the world, ſo that all men ſhould come after him. And thus we
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65506:187"/>find after his death and Reſurrection, he gives his diſciples commiſſion to go and <hi>teach all nations,</hi> Mat. 28.19. or, as it is in St. <hi>Mark, go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> Mark 16.15. And to that purpoſe they have the gift of tongues beſtowed on them, that ſo they might be able to teach all nations as their Lord had commanded them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Now we ſhall ſoon find the Goſpel preached to the Gentiles; we read of the <hi>Ethyopian</hi> Treaſurer, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion baptized into the <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith.</hi> But what ſhall I need ſpeak of them, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> is made a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who tells us of the fruit of his preaching alſo, <hi>viz. the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 15.18.

               <p>I ſhall ſhew then that the ſucceſs of the Goſpel was ſuch as does neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that the Religion which he preached and planted in the world did come from God. where, as we go along, it will be eaſie for us to underſtand that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetiſm</hi> can have no ſhare in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; now it will appear that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and alſo that the Goſpel which he and his diſciples preached comes from Heaven; in a word, that the Chriſtian Religion is not onely true, but the onely true Religion, if we do but well conſider its ſucceſs and progreſs in the world.

They were
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65506:189"/>men very unlikely to doe any great things, having no reputation for depth of wiſedom or any thing of power or worldly greatneſs. Such were the firſt planters of the Goſpel; And who would look for any great ſucceſs from ſo ſmall a beginning? Who would have believed that ſuch men as theſe had been big enough to have grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the <hi>wiſedom</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>malice</hi> of their Countrey men the <hi>Jews,</hi> with the rudeneſs and hardineſs of all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then world!

               <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>credenda</hi> or matters of ſaith that it did contain which muſt needs ſeem very uncouth and ſtrange, if not very unreaſonable to the world: As that the world was made, and made of nothing, when <hi>ex nihilo nil fit,</hi> was a maxim in the Heathen Philoſophy. That there is but one God, when in the Heathen world there were thought to be many Gods and many Lords. That though there were but one God, yet there were three perſons, and theſe three were one.

                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:65506:190"/>That they muſt believe <hi>Jeſus</hi> and the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was ſo ſtrange a thing to the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſophers that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome called him <hi>babler,</hi> and others were ſo ignorant of what was meant by the Reſurrection that they took it for a God: <hi>He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to be a ſetter forth of ſtrange Gods, becauſe he preathed unto them</hi>

They are taught to place their hopes in a Crucified Lord, and to own him as their onely Saviour and Redeemer, whom they had never ſeen or heard of before, whom none of their Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers had ſpoken of. They muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive the Reſurrection of the dead which they had not heard of before. And that there is no name under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by which they can be ſaved but by the name of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> And this they did, which they could never have been perſwaded to have done, had not theſe things been from God, to whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous

               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>agenda,</hi> or precepts of the Goſpel; they were ſuch as were very unlikely to have obtained in the world, had not theſe things been from God: For what is it that the Goſpel teaches them? To deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, to walk righteouſly and ſoberly and Godly in this preſent world. It forbids not onely the doing injuries but the revenging of them. It forbids not onely evil actions but an evil thought and intention of the heart. It does not onely forbid adultery but alſo a wanton glance: and is ſo far from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing murther, that it moſt ſeverely forbids hatred and raſh anger. It not onely forbids perjuries, but requires of us that we ſhould not ſwear at all. It ties our hands, locks up our eyes, chains our thoughts, and reſtrains all the irregular deſires, and warmer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of fleſh and bloud. It will not allow the wiſeſt Philoſopher to make any oſtentation of his parts or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Nor the greateſt Captain or General to boaſt of his valour, but teaches them both to be very humble and very peaceable. It teaches us to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65506:191"/>undervalue all the grandeur of the world, all its riches and honours, and pleaſures, and commands us rather to foregoe them all, with life it ſelf, than to deny the ſaith of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> It requires men to love God with all their heart, and their neighbour as themſelves. To forgive their enemies, to pray for their perſecutors, to do good to thoſe that do evil unto us. It forbids us to give blow for blow, or railing for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. It commands us to give Alms to the Poor, and to give to every one that asketh, be he friend or enemy, good or bad, thankfull or ungratefull; and when we have, it commands us to make no boaſts or brags, but to expect a recompence onely from him that ſees in ſecret. It lays a great reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our tongues, which it obliges us moſt ſeverely to keep in order: It will not allow us to ſpeak evil of our Brother, to call him fool or <hi>Raka.</hi> It forbids us to judge another man as we would eſcape a ſeverer Judgment our ſelves. It forbids us to be buſie-bodies, or to intermeddle in other mens matters. And is ſo far from allowing the tongue in lying or ſwearing, that it may not be ſuffered in an idle word, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65506:192"/>jeſt. It tells us we muſt be blameleſs and harmleſs, and then, if it be poſſible, and as much as lieth in us we muſt live peaceably with all men. Unto all this we may add that it will not allow any other Religion: The Heathen world muſt abandon their <hi>Idols</hi> if they receive the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They muſt forſake that Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try under which their Fathers proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long, and they were brought up in: <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> muſt be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger adored, and all her Prieſts and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſmiths muſt be laid aſide. All Idols muſt be removed where <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes, and all the ancient ceremonies and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities with which they were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped muſt for ever be diſuſed. That which was but now worſhipped, and had been ſo of old time, muſt be caſt to the moles and to the batts: But who ſhall perſwade and obtain this? None can do it without the help of that God who made Heaven and earth. For here is all the power, and malice and cunning of men and Devils to be encountred with. The Devil had gotten an old and long poſſeſſion, the Heathen world is ſtrong and mighty, cunning and prejudicate; of a vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:65506:192"/>and a mighty force: Who ſhall perſwade the <hi>Greeks</hi> to leave off their Robberies and to live righteouſly? Or the warlike <hi>Romans</hi> to put up their ſwords and revenge no injuries? Who ſhall obtain of the world to throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Idols and receive a Crucified <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Who can ever hope that thoſe nations that grew to their greatneſs by bloud, and violence, ſhould ever learn the way of peace and deſtroy no more! Will they that boaſted in doing injuries be taught to bear them! Or they that were wont to kill without remorſe be afraid of being angry without a cauſe! Will they that were adulterers become afraid of an unchaſt thought or glance! Will the wiſe and conceited Orators become fools that they may be wiſe! who can expect that they that had as many Gods as territories and provinces ſhould be perſwaded to have but one! Or that thoſe men that were indulged their luſts by the example of their Gods, or the permiſſion of their laws, ſhould ever accept of a Religion that is ſo ſevere that it requires them all to be rooted out! Certainly this will be too great a work for a few <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans</hi> to bring to paſs: They might
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:65506:193"/>as ſoon hope to remove mountains and ſhake all the pillars of the earth, yet was this brought to paſs, and that by the fooliſhneſs of preaching alſo; the fierce warriour becomes tame, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor becomes a preacher, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſerved many Idols, now one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge the one true God, and whom he hath ſent <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now this could never have been done had not God almighty done it, nor would he ever have done it had not <hi>Jeſus</hi> been the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But it will be the more ſtrange ſtill that this doctrine ſhould prevail if we do but duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Praemia,</hi> the rewards, or the promiſes of the Goſpel to thoſe that ſhould receive it and obey it. We ſhall find them ſuch as were very unlikely to prevail with a wicked and unbelei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving world. It promiſes them <hi>no proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity</hi> in this <hi>world,</hi> nor yet <hi>any ſenſual delights</hi> in that which is to <hi>come,</hi> as the Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> does: And yet theſe were the things which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then world moſt admired, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lived by ſenſe and not by ſaith: It promiſes them no Kingdoms or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhips, no Victories or triumphs, no
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:65506:193"/>wealth or honours, nor yet the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Wine or Women: in a word it is ſo far from offering to them theſe things, that it teaches them, aye, and obliges them alſo, to deſpiſe all theſe things, to undervalue them, to be dead to all theſe allurements, and to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and root out of their Souls all thoſe irregular deſires which tranſport them after any of theſe things. The Goſpel promiſes <hi>good things</hi> indeed but they are <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and ſo very unlike to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon <hi>Carnal</hi> men: They are good things but they are <hi>unſeen,</hi> and ſo not likely to prevail upon thoſe that live by <hi>ſenſe:</hi> they are good indeed but yet they are <hi>removed</hi> and at a <hi>diſtance,</hi> and who could expect the world ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves of their preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the hopes of theſe <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>unſeen reverſions?</hi> Who ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the rich to abandon their wealth for the hopes of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Or who can prevail with the voluptuous to renounce their ſenſual pleaſures, out of the hopes of thoſe joyes that are at God's right hand? What Rhetorick ſhall perſwade the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious man to prefer a future glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the honours he derives from his
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:65506:194"/>Prince, or acquires by his valour! We find this a very hard matter now when theſe men profeſs the Goſpel, but how much harder muſt it needs be then, when the Goſpel was a ſtranger to the world, when it had ſcarcely any friends, and very many and great oppoſers? What is there offered in the Goſpel that could tempt an unbelieving world! Had it offered <hi>riches,</hi> there might well have been a crowd of <hi>covetous</hi> world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ready to embrace it. Had it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>ſenſual pleaſures</hi> it would have been <hi>welcome</hi> to the <hi>whole herd</hi> of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures:</hi> could it have ſecured its profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of worldly honours, nothing ſhould have been more acceptable to all that were ambitious: But here is none of thoſe things to be had, but it tells us of things to come, and we muſt have faith to believe them, as well as patience to wait for them. Now then certainly this Religion, which offered no other rewards, could never have prevailed upon the world, as we know it did, had it not been from God, and had not <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom we preach, been the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But this will be the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely ſtill, that the Goſpel ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail if we conſider.</p>

The <hi>Pericula,</hi> the dangers, and afflictions and many miſeries that the embracing the Goſpel would expoſe them to, that ſhould entertain it. This riſes higher, and makes the ſucceſs of the Goſpel more improbable than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We ſaw before that it promiſes no worldly happineſs, but now we ſhall find that it expoſes its profeſſors to many miſeries and afflictions, and tells them ſad ſtories of diſgrace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, bonds and impriſonment, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps death it ſelf. It foretells that they which do live Godly ſhall ſuffer perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and that we muſt through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tribulations enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: What I named laſt brought no temptation to draw the world to this profeſſion, but this, one would think, ſhould bring diſcouragement enough to affright them from it. Inſtead of promiſing eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures it rather brings with it great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and tribulations. <hi>Jeſus</hi> tells his Diſciples what they muſt expect. <hi>The time cometh that whoſoever killeth you will think that he doeth God ſervice,</hi> Joh. 16.2. Here is little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then for the world to receive the Goſpel which is like to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65506:195"/>to ſuch hazards and dangers. We have a Proverb among us, that <hi>men will not make any haſte to that market where they are like to meet with nothing but blows.</hi> A man would eaſily believe men would not be very forward to relinquiſh their proſperous Religion, and entertain an afflicted and a perſecuted Goſpel; to leave the <hi>gainfull worſhip</hi> of the great <hi>Diana,</hi> and to embrace a <hi>profeſſion</hi> that is <hi>every where ſpoken againſt;</hi> to forſake the image that fell down from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and to worſhip <hi>Jeſus</hi> that was hanged on a Croſs. A man might (one would think) aſſoon perſwade an army to leave their direct and ſmoother way to their enemies, and to march through dangerous woods, and precipices, quick-ſands and lakes. Or as ſoon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a great Tyrant that he ſhould deſtroy himſelf, as to perſwade the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing world to venture all their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, wealth and honours, aye and their bloud too, in the profeſſion of that Goſpel that did not ſo much as promiſe them any recompence in the ſame kind. Yet we know this was done, the Religion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced upon theſe terms. The rich were willing to become poor, to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65506:195"/>part with their poſſeſſions here for the hopes of a future glory: the honourable were glad to be laid low, and ſtript of all their properties for the ſake of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Baniſhment or chains, priſons or death are very welcome for the Goſpel's ſake. No Wheels or Racks, no Rods or Axes, no bolts or chains, hunger or thirſt, fire or ſword ſhall be able to make them offer to an Idol or deny their Lord. Nay they were ſo reſolute that they wearied their perſecutors by their patience and conſtancy; they could not find out torments exquiſite and great enough for them: They were not daunted at the cruelties of <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> or any of the following <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours. Nor were they onely the great preachers of the Goſpel that were thus reſolute and hardy, but alſo the Laity, aye Women and Children, thoſe of the weaker ſex and more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years. Nor was the Religion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired or weakned by theſe heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but it grows and proſpers great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This <hi>bloud of Martyrs proves a fruitfull ſeed;</hi> and very ſtrangely fruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies and brings forth Children unto God.

               <p>But from the Doctrine it ſelf let us proceed now,</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the manner of it's ſpreading and propagation, and we ſhall find that alſo very unlikely to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed had it not been from God, and had not <hi>Jeſus</hi> been the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Nay, do I ſay unlikely; I may truly ſay it had been utterly impoſſible it ſhould have got that ground it did, had it not been from God, and had not that God who made the world given it his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Let us then well weigh theſe following ſeverals:
<list>
                     <item>1. That the Goſpel was not propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in the world by humane Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or excellence of Speech. The firſt Preachers of it were men of great plainneſs and ſimplicity, bred up not in the Schools of the Learned, not in wiſedom of the world, not in any of the famous Accademies, or under the teachings of the wiſe Philoſophers, but they were illiterate <hi>Galileans,</hi> they were men of mean trades and occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, men that had not been uſed to ſpeak in Senates and audiences of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65506:197"/>men not uſed to defend cauſes, not brought up in the cunning of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates and Proctors, and mercenary pleaders. Such men might have been thought to have done much by the ſtrength of their parts, and the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their wit, and might have been judged ſufficient to have made a weak cauſe defenſible: They had none of the advantages of dignified perſons, which might commend them to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great States: ſo that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor and obſcure, their wiſedom was like to be the leſs regarded, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt certain truth, that <hi>the poor man's wiſedom is deſpiſed:</hi> Upon theſe diſadvantages did the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel ſet forth into a cunning, and wicked, and potent world. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is true St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a man of Learning, bred up at the feet of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel,</hi> and ſo doubtleſs well verſed in the learning of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and very fit to deal with them: But then he was made the Doctour of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> And we hear what he tells his <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified. And my Speech, and my Preaching was not with enticing words
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65506:197"/>of man's wiſedom.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2, 4. He was a man much hated by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and like to doe no great matters among the <hi>Romans,</hi> one would think, whoſe Priſoner he was when he came to <hi>Rome.</hi> He was a man indeed of learning, but of no authority; a man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but yet of mean preſence, and contemptible ſpeech: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.10. So that the progreſs of the Goſpel may not be aſcribed to any great eloquence, or Rhetorick, any skill or artifice of men, but onely to the power of God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5. For by the <hi>fooliſhneſs of</hi> Preaching God taught the world <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> by <hi>weak</hi> things he overturned the <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and by things which <hi>are not,</hi> he overcame things <hi>that are.</hi> He that did deſtroy the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> at the noiſe of a ſhout, and overcome the <hi>Canaanites</hi> by the hands of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and diſcomfited the <hi>Midianites</hi> great Army with Trumpets, and the breaking of Pitchers, and killed the great <hi>Goliah</hi> with a Stripling and his ſling, it was he and he alone that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, and gave that ſucceſs to very weak, and very unlikely means. This He did and none but He could doe, and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65506:198"/>and therefore this is a ſufficient proof that the Goſpel comes from God, and that that <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom we Preach, is the very <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Nor yet was the Goſpel propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by force of Arms, as the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath been, which has made its way in the world by the dint of Sword. But Chriſtianity was not thus planted; it denounced no War to thoſe that refuſed it, it gave out no menaces to that purpoſe: This it neither <hi>did,</hi> nor <hi>would,</hi> nor <hi>could</hi> it do. The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall not need fear the <hi>Galileans</hi> Sword; <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſent abroad no fighting men; there is no Horſe prepared for this battel, no Spears or Bows: Theſe are the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Prince of peace, who are ſo far from War, that they come to require the nations to learn War no more, and to beat their Swords into Plough-ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning hooks. The Goſpel had no potent Princes or States that favoured it, that ſtood up for its defence and maintenance, there were none of theſe powers that took upon them the Title of <hi>Defenders of the Faith.</hi> Nay, and they were ſo far from doing it, that
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65506:198"/>they were its avowed enemies, and drew their Sword againſt it. So that the firſt Preachers came naked and unarmed into a furious, and potent, and idolatrous world, Preaching the Goſpel of peace, and the ſevere Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of a crucified <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The armour they had was Spiritual, and an Armour of light, an armour which the victorious <hi>Romans</hi> had neither u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor yet feared. They were <hi>girt</hi> about with <hi>truth,</hi> that was all their <hi>military girdle:</hi> They put on the <hi>breaſt-plate</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>ſhield</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> and the <hi>helmet of ſalvation,</hi> and the <hi>ſword</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which is, the <hi>word of God;</hi> and had their <hi>feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of peace:</hi> Eph. 6. Theſe were the armour of the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel; and who could expect that they ſhould with theſe, overcome mighty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Provinces. And yet with theſe preparations did they ſucceed and overcome the greateſt nations, and brought them into the obedience of the Goſpel: Let us hear what the Apoſtle ſays to this purpoſe: <hi>We do not War</hi> (ſays he) <hi>after the fleſh</hi> (<hi>for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65506:199"/>but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds</hi>) <hi>caſting down Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and every high thing that exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt:</hi> 2 Cor. 10.3, 4, 5. This is evident then, that they did not force the Goſpel upon the world; they did not convey it by the Sword, or Battel-bow; they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, nor could do this: and yet for all this it ſucceeded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, aye, and triumph't alſo over all the power, the policy, the ſtrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of the Devil and all his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And got that ground without blows and force, which it had never gotten with it. To what then muſt this victory be imputed? Not to the Pike and Sword, but to the energy and force of Truth, and to the mighty bleſſing and miraculous providence of God. It was God that brought this to paſs, which men could never have done: And this is a ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that this Religion comes from God: Had it been a lye it could never have had that ſucceſs by theſe unlikely means: had it been from the Devil, or the World, ſure it would have made
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65506:199"/>uſe of the inſtruments and ſtrategems of War, to have made room for it in the world. But that which is from God needs none of theſe aſſiſtances, and helps. And this doubtleſs is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good argument of the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, that it did not make its way by the power of the Sword, nor was it preſerved that way. The Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> indeed ſpread far, but it was by the help of theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weapons. To the inſtruments of War, and the diſſenſions and back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Chriſtians, under God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, it own much if not moſt of its ſucceſs. Nay, what was it elſe that did uphold Idolatry, but the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of War and ſlaughter? Falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions are forced to uſe this force and violence, which the truth which comes from God, and hath his bleſſing, does not need. The pure and undefiled, and primitive doctrine of the Goſpel did not uſe, nor yet need theſe aids. Indeed the <hi>Apoſtatized</hi> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath falſely called her ſelf the Catholick Church, ſince ſhe left the true Faith of the Goſpel, hath beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her ſelf to theſe carnal weapons. And 'tis eaſie to know the cauſe of it
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65506:200"/>alſo: For when ſhe wanted the evidence of truth, ſhe then was fain to run to the power of the Sword. By this Sword ſhe cut aſunder thoſe knots ſhe was not able to untie: And whom ſhe could not confute, ſhe would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn to the fire and fagot. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power muſt be called in, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her grandeur and power. St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys are not ſufficient, unleſs ſhe unſheath his Sword: ſhe is now bolſtered up by the powers of this world, and when ſhe wants aid from the ſword of the Spirit, ſhe will derive it from the Sword of Princes. Her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings ſhall need to be no objection againſt what I have ſaid. Who though ſhe call herſelf the Catholick Church, is very far from deſerving that name, and hath rather ſhewed herſelf by theſe her actions the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> than the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſhe hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her cauſe to be bad, which could not be maintained and upheld without the aſſiſtance of Secular force. The firſt planters of the Goſpel uſed none of theſe weapons. We read of none they burned for Hereticks, no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths interdicted for hindring their worldly greatneſs, no Navies or
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65506:200"/>Armies raiſed againſt thoſe that would not acknowledge them as their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours. Theſe have been the pitifull arts of that <hi>unclean Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> which is an argument that however ſhe vainly boaſts her ſelf <hi>Catholick,</hi> yet ſhe does not ſhew her ſelf in theſe things at all <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> For the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> never got its growth by theſe carnal weapons.</item>
                     <item>3. It was propagated by ſufferings, by patient enduring of tribulations: Prayers and Tears were the onely wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of the Primitive, and undefiled Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Bloud of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> was that fruitfull feed that did ſo ſtrangely increaſe and multiply: Which is an argument that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and this Religion came from God: Had it been otherwiſe, it had not been poſſible, but thoſe firſt perſecutions had quite rooted it out of the world. Had it not been of God, it muſt needs have ſo fallen out. We ſee in the greateſt Rebellions how ſoon they are ſtopped, when the chief Heads and Leaders are taken and puniſhed. This puts an end to any Inſurrection or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy: And ſo would it have done by Chriſtianity alſo, had it not been
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65506:201"/>from Heaven, and been accompanied with truth and righteouſneſs. So that fire and ſword cannot vanquiſh it, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and chains, and death it ſelf cannot ſtop its courſe: It muſt needs be a good cauſe that bears up againſt all the malice, the meanaces, the puniſhments, that a wicked world could deviſe or inflict. Aye, and that perſons of all ſorts and degrees ſhould ſeal this Doctrine with their Bloud too: young as well as old, rich as well as poor, people as well as their Teachers, women as well as men, thoſe that were remote and far diſtant from one another. <hi>Nemo gratis malus.</hi> It cannot be imagined that ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ſorts, and ſo remote from one another, ſhould conſpire and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent together to bear witneſs to a lye: That they ſhould venture their lives, and all that which the world calls good, upon an untruth! Certainly no man can be ſo fond as to believe this: This Martyrdom of Chriſtians, and the growth of Chriſtianity under it, is a good proof that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that the Religion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> came from God. For certainly had it not been from God, it could never have
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65506:201"/>born up from ſo ſmall a beginning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo mighty an oppoſition: And therefore it was a wiſe ſpeech of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel</hi> to the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who were ſo forward to perſecute the firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel, <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>refrain from theſe men, and let them alone: for it this counſel or this work be of men it will come to nought. But if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it; leſt happily ye be found to fight againſt God:</hi> Act. 5.38, 39. And this he well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades from the deſtruction of <hi>Theudas</hi> and his Complices, and alſo of <hi>Judas</hi> the <hi>Galilean</hi> and thoſe that obeyed him. To which may alſo well be added this, that whoever ſince hath pretended himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or his forerunner, hath been ſo far from perſwading it, that he hath indeed come to nought, and miſerably chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and abuſed his credulous followers.

                  <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
                  <p>What was predicted of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus.</hi> This appeared in the birth of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in his <hi>Office,</hi> and <hi>Character,</hi> in his <hi>Works,</hi> in his <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and the <hi>ſpreading</hi> of his <hi>doctrine.</hi> The adore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able providence of God in bringing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents to paſs. This ſhewed in very many particulars. This is a farther proof that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF what hath been ſaid before be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, we ſhall upon ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent evidence conclude that our <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> came from God. Not that I have ſaid all, which might have been ſaid, in ſo weighty an argument; but that which hath before been inſiſted upon is ſufficient to convince a lover of truth.</p>
               <p>That there was a <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed, and deſcribed in the old Teſlament is not conteſted between the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the <hi>Jews;</hi> nor do the <hi>Jews</hi> deny
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65506:203"/>that <hi>Jeſus</hi> lived, and that he ſuffered by the hands of their forefathers as we ſay he did. We believe the writings of the old Teſtament which the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves acknowledge to be Divine. Neither they nor any man living hath any juſt cauſe to call in queſtion the authority of the books of the New Teſtament, which give us an account of the birth and life; of the miracles, and doctrine; of the death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; of the Aſcenſion, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Here's nothing repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theſe books in it ſelf incredible; nothing that is light and trifling; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unbecoming God; nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt good manners; but we have the ſame reaſons to believe the truth of theſe things which we have for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtory which we do believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting: The ſame we have and much more. Allowing then but the truth of the matter of fact, which we have no ſhadow of reaſon to call in queſtion, it will abundantly appear from what hath been ſaid that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For there was not a word that fell to the ground, which was predicted of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but it was fulfilled in our
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65506:204"/>
                  <hi>Jeſus:</hi> There was nothing ſo minute or ſmall but it was accompliſhed and fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Let us to this purpoſe recollect thoſe particulars mentioned before, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their exact accompliſhment in our <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will begin with his <hi>birth.</hi> We find that the firſt promiſe which was made of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was under the Character of the ſeed of the <hi>Woman,</hi> (Gen. 3.15.) And this Woman was to be a <hi>Virgin</hi> alſo according to a prediction afterwards, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.) This was fulfilled in our <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who was <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> (Gal. 4.4.) And <hi>born of a Virgin.</hi> (Mat. 1.18, and v. 22, 23.) For the <hi>lineage</hi> and kindred of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that is alſo predicted, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould be of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> of the <hi>Family</hi> of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David</hi> (Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah. 5.2. Gen. 49.10. Iſa. 11.10. Jer. 23.5.) This was alſo fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> (Luk. 1.27, 69. Mat. 1.1.) The <hi>place</hi> where the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be born was <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and this was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> (Micah. 5.2. with Mat. 2.5, 6.) Again, <hi>Jeſus</hi> was born at that time when the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be born according to the predictions of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65506:204"/>the old Teſtament. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Meſſias</hi> were to be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo was <hi>Jeſus</hi> alſo, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.14.) If he were to live in <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſo did <hi>Jeſus.</hi> (Iſa. 9.1, 2, 3. Mat. 2.22, 23. with ch. 4.14.) If the <hi>Meſſias</hi> be deſcribed as <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> as <hi>righteous,</hi> as <hi>lowly,</hi> all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to our. <hi>Jeſus</hi> alſo, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6.11.5. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.9. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. and ch. 12.18.) If the <hi>Meſſias</hi> were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the <hi>ſecond Temple,</hi> ſo did <hi>Jeſus.</hi> (Hag. 2.7, 9. with Joh. 18.20.)</p>
               <p>The very works, which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to doe, <hi>Jeſus</hi> did, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.5, 6. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.4, 5.) And they were ſuch works as none could do without the aſſiſtance of God himſelf.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Meſſias</hi> were to ſuffer, ſo did <hi>Jeſus:</hi> He dyed after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and at the ſame time, and in the ſame place, and under the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which were predicted of old concerning the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The very Perſon which betrayed him, the price for which he was ſold, the company that ſuffered with him, the uſage he was to receive in his laſt minutes, theſe things were foretold of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65506:205"/>accompliſhed in our <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The very parting of his Garments, the Scoffs of the multitude, his behaviour and his laſt words, the exempting his bones from being broken, theſe things were predicted, and prefigured of old, and all fulfilled in <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and ſo was his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable burial and interment as I have ſhewed before at large in the ſeventh Chapter of this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to riſe from the dead, ſo did <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He roſe again the third day as he himſelf had foretold, and as had been predicted of the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as:</hi> Of the truth of the matter of fact we have the utmoſt evidence. After this he went up into Heaven, and ſent thence the miraculous gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and his Religion was preached to every creature.</p>
               <p>And as it was univerſally preached ſo it ſpread univerſally alſo, and that it did ſo is an argument that it came from God. From a <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>unlikely</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it came to a very <hi>great encreaſe.</hi> It proſpered under afflictions and the ſevereſt perſecutions. It put to flight the Devil and his Kingdom, that made head againſt it with Sword and Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, without ſtriking a ſtroke. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65506:205"/>upon <hi>warlike</hi> Nations without the <hi>inſtruments</hi> of <hi>War.</hi> It triumphed over the <hi>wiſe</hi> without any worldly <hi>elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> It vanquiſhed the <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> by inſtruments that were very <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>inconſiderable.</hi> It advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by prayers and tears, by patience under ſufferings, by meekneſs and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs. Thus it conquered and grew big in ſpight of all the power, the malice and cunning of the Devil and all his inſtruments: No fire could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, no enemies Sword could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, no proſcriptions could baniſh it out of the world. It was too ſtrong for the powerfull Tyrant, it ſeared neither his Rod or Axes; nay, it deſpiſed his greateſt torments, and moſt ſtudied cruelties.</p>
               <p>It is farther to be conſidered, that as all which was predicted of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was (as hath been ſhewn) fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſo theſe accompliſhments came to paſs by a moſt ſtupendious and adorable providence of God; in ſuch a way and ſuch a manner, through ſo many unlikely hoods and ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingences as ſpeaks a miraculous and over-ruling Providence of God. Here's nothing of the wiſedom and craft of
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:65506:206"/>men, nothing of their power and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation to be acknowledged: <hi>The Stone which the Builders rejected, the ſame became the head-ſtone of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> And from thence we may very juſtly infer that this <hi>was the Lord's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> And if we attend to it with due application of mind, it will be <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in our eyes.</hi> This conſideration muſt needs ſtrike every pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Soul with a profound ſenſe of the unſpeakable wiſedom, as well as good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, in contriving our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ways that men could never have deviſed, and in making good and accompliſhing what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and foretold by ways and means to humane wiſedom, very unlikely, and very diſproportionate. I ſhall look back upon what I have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the completing the predictions in our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſhew the wonderfull providence of God in bringing Events to paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and ſo it muſt be: God had foretold it, the <hi>Jews</hi> expected it, and the <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi> when they were conſulted by <hi>Herod</hi> where he was to be born, tell him the ſame [<hi>Mat.</hi> 2.4, 5.]
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:65506:206"/>It was very unlikely that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould have been born there, for he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> there his Mother lived when ſhe was great with Child, at a great diſtance from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in her own Tribe upon an occaſion of a decree of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> (Luk. 2. &amp;c.) Who therein though unwittingly was an occaſion of fulfilling a Divine Prophecy.</p>
               <p>Again the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was promiſed under the Character of the <hi>ſeed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that expreſſion does not exclude the Womans relation to a man, but will admit the Woman to be eſpouſed and betrothed. It was afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted that he ſhould be born of a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin:</hi> It was not likely indeed that this ſhould be verified in <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For beſides that what was foretold was againſt the courſe of nature (<hi>viz.</hi> that a <hi>Virgin</hi> ſhould conceive and bring forth a Son) ſo it was very probable that ſhe that was eſpouſed to a man (and in the ſenſe of the law his wife) would not continue a <hi>Virgin.</hi> But God had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told this, and he will make his word good: And <hi>Jeſus</hi> was born of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Virgin</hi> even after ſhe was eſpouſed unto <hi>Joſeph.</hi> She continued a <hi>Virgin</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:65506:207"/>though ſhe were <hi>betrothed,</hi> and ſo far had upon her the obligation of a <hi>wife.</hi> Thus at once was <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſeed of a <hi>Woman</hi> (as that word implies her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed to a man) and the Son of a <hi>Virgin</hi> alſo. This was a moſt ſurpriſing thing to the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> her ſelf: She ſaid unto the <hi>Angel,</hi> who told her what ſhould come to paſs, <hi>How ſhall this be?</hi> (Luk. 1.34.) I ſhall add to this head the words of a very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſon which he ſpake upon this occaſion. <hi>I am fully perſwaded</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that if either</hi> Jew <hi>or</hi> Atheiſt <hi>would but ſearch the Scriptures with hearts as devoid of prejudice, and minds as free from other thoughts and cares, as moſt men bring to famous plays or comedies: This contemplation would enforce the one to acknowledge, that the prophecies in old time came not by the will of man: The other, that</hi> Jeſus <hi>the Son of</hi> Mary <hi>was he of whom</hi> Moſes <hi>and all the Prophets ſpake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be born of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of the houſe and family of <hi>David:</hi> And to that purpoſe that Tribe and that family muſt not onely continue, but continue ſo diſtinct that it might be known who belonged to the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:65506:207"/>one and the other. It is not a common thing that any family and kindred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſo many hundred years: And indeed it was not likely that they ſhould have continued and continued diſtinct and ſeparate conſidering the great changes that paſſed upon and threatened them either with utter ruine or confuſion. They were in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of one and the other in the days of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and in the captivity of <hi>Babylon:</hi> And in after times the houſe of <hi>David</hi> lay neglected for many years; but ſo it was they are not quite deſtroyed till this Son of <hi>David</hi> is born: The birth of <hi>Jeſus</hi> makes good what God had promiſed of old time. And the Divine Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> does near the time when <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> lived, and to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, who had the opportunity of knowing the truth in this matter, affirm that it was <hi>Evident that our Lord ſprang out of Judah,</hi> (Heb. 7.14.) And <hi>Jeſus</hi> was known to be, and commonly owned to be, the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> Mat. 1.1. What God had promiſed of old he (and he was onely able to doe it) in due time made good.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be born before
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:65506:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>the deſtruction of the ſecond Temple, and while the <hi>Jews</hi> were a diſtinct peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Polity: He was to add Glory to the latter houſe, and to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Jews</hi> were quite ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. This was foretold of the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> (Gen. 49.10. Hag. 2. Mal. 3.) The <hi>Jews</hi> before <hi>Jeſus</hi> was born were in great meaſure in the hands of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> of an <hi>Idumoean</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, had for ſome time lorded it over them; but then he is born while the <hi>Jews</hi> continue a diſtinct people, live by their own laws, and in their own land; and goes into that Temple which, according to the foregoing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, he was to enter into, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der glorious by his preſence and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The great deliverer comes at his appointed time, <hi>viz.</hi> at the declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Polity, and before the expiration of the times predicted of old. And though the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> affairs were very low, and their polity near to an end, yet is <hi>Jeſus</hi> born before their final deſtruction which was at hand. For the Counſel of God that ſhall ſtand.</p>
               <p>It was not very likely that he who was <hi>born</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> beyond the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:65506:208"/>of his Mother, and reputed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould thence go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at his return go into <hi>Galilee</hi> and live there: but both the one and the other were predicted of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and, how unlikely ſoever they were to come to paſs, they were fulfilled in our <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He was carried into <hi>Egypt</hi> upon occaſion of the cruelty of <hi>Herod,</hi> and, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thence, into <hi>Galilee;</hi> upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Archelaus</hi> his reign in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and the warning which <hi>Joſeph</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God in a dream, [<hi>Hoſea.</hi> 11.1. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.22.]</p>
               <p>Who would have expected a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> then in <hi>Iſrael</hi> where prophecy had ceaſed ever ſince the days of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> and there was now no ſuch kind of men known among the <hi>Jews?</hi> Or that this great Prophet who was born in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and near the great City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould live in the remote and obſcure Countrey of <hi>Galilee?</hi> That he ſhould live in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from whence there was hardly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known any Prophet to proceed, and where he was like to continue with little notice, regard or obſervation? And that he that lived in ſo obſcure a
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65506:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>Countrey ſhould do ſo great and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious works, to the wonder and aſtoniſhment of thoſe that ſaw them? That ſuch an illuſtrious perſon ſhould proceed from ſo obſcure a Countrey? (<hi>Joh.</hi> 7.41.)</p>
               <p>If we go on to conſider the death of <hi>Jeſus</hi> we ſhall find all things agree to the predictions of old, and came to paſs in ſuch a manner as ſpeaks a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous providence of God. That he who was born ſhould die, hath nothing of wonder in it. But it is very ſtrange that he ſhould deliver him to death, who at the ſame time pronounced him inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. That he ſhould dye upon a Croſs, whom the people were ſo forward to have <hi>ſtoned!</hi> That he ſhould be <hi>Crucified</hi> who (if he had been guilty) ſhould by the law of the Countrey have been <hi>ſtoned!</hi> That he who had ſo many <hi>enemies</hi> ſhould yet be betrayed by one of his own <hi>diſciples!</hi> That he who had the <hi>bag,</hi> and had all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Jeſus</hi> had, ſhould betray him for ſo vile a price as <hi>thirty peices</hi> of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver!</hi> That the money for which he was ſold, this <hi>price</hi> of <hi>bloud,</hi> ſhould be employed in a work of <hi>mercy,</hi> to buy a <hi>field</hi> to Lury <hi>Strangers</hi> in! That he
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65506:209"/>ſhould drink <hi>Vinegar</hi> on the Croſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a <hi>Narcotick</hi> potion of <hi>Myrrh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine,</hi> contrary to the conſtant cuſtome and uſage of the Countrey where he ſuffered! That the Souldiers ſhould caſt <hi>lots</hi> for his <hi>Coat,</hi> contrary to their conſtant cuſtome, when they had <hi>parted</hi> his <hi>Garments,</hi> and did ſo by them who were Crucified with him! That he ſhould dye among <hi>thieves</hi> and <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors</hi> who ſpent his time in <hi>doing good!</hi> That he who lived ſo <hi>uſefully</hi> ſhould be ſcoffed and <hi>taunted</hi> at when he hung upon the <hi>Croſs;</hi> and that the multitude who are wont to pity the <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Criminal,</hi> ſhould put off all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and in a <hi>ſet form of words</hi> deride him in his greateſt miſery! That <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſhould hold his <hi>peace,</hi> who ſuffered wrongfully, when his enemies were <hi>impatient</hi> and <hi>clamorous,</hi> and the whole creation <hi>groaned,</hi> and was <hi>diſordered!</hi> That when it was the cuſtome to <hi>break</hi> the <hi>bones</hi> of the <hi>Crucified,</hi> and 'twas practized at that time upon them who ſuffered with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and they who were concerned, came with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to break his alſo, that yet a <hi>bone</hi> of <hi>him</hi> ſhould <hi>not be broken!</hi> That he who was <hi>Crucified</hi> (which was a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:65506:210"/>puniſhment,<note place="margin">Caſaubon <hi>Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. p.</hi> 464. <hi>edit.</hi> Francf. 1615.</note> and none of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh</hi> capital ones) ſhould be <hi>buried</hi> alſo contrary to the practice of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who did not bury thoſe who dyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Croſs! That he who <hi>dyed</hi> among malefactors ſhould not be buried with them alſo! That he who dyed ſo <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious</hi> a death ſhould have an <hi>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burial!</hi> That perſons of the <hi>higheſt rank</hi> and Character ſhould agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his honourable interment! Theſe things are ſo ſtrange and ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, ſo much beyond what any Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory beſides does afford us, that if we believe but the matter of fact (which we have all the reaſon in the world to believe) we cannot but find great cauſe to adore the all-wiſe God who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in <hi>Jeſus</hi> whatever was foretold of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we now proceed to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> we muſt be forced to acknowledge the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruling hand of God. That he who dyed roſe from the dead was an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond exception of a Divine power, man could contribute nothing toward ſo ſtupendious a work. Nay, there was all done, that could be done by men, both to hinder his Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65506:210"/>(which <hi>Jeſus</hi> had foretold) and to hinder the ſpreading of it, and the belief thereof in the world. His ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were prepared to do all they could, and they did it; by making his <hi>Sepulchre ſure,</hi> by <hi>ſealing the ſtone,</hi> and by <hi>ſetting</hi> a <hi>watch,</hi> Mat. 27.66. This they did to prevent the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But all this would not do. They who had power to put <hi>Jeſus</hi> to death have no power to hinder his Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When this ſucceeded not, the next courſe they had to take was to hinder the <hi>belief</hi> of the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Though they could not hinder him from riſing again yet they apply themſelves vigorouſly to <hi>ſtifle</hi> the <hi>truth:</hi> This was their next care.

                  <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion more Excellent than that given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the beſt in the World. The <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion not worthy of regard. The wiſer Heathens guilty of great inconſiſtencies and evil Principles. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> upon ſundry accounts very blameable. The Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> came from God; in what ſenſe it was a perfect Law. It was not unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A general diſtribution of the Precepts of that Law. The defects of it. <hi>(I)</hi> As a rule of life: Many of its Precepts not good in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; They obliged the <hi>Jews</hi> onely, and were annexed to their Land, or ſome part of it: Many of them <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical. (II)</hi> The reward annexed to the Obedience of that Law was but Temporal. <hi>(III)</hi> It was not attended with the promiſe of Divine aſſiſtance. <hi>(IV)</hi> Nor was there that hope of pardon which was afterward given in the Goſpel. The Sacrifices allowed to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:65506:214"/>that purpoſe very defective: This ſhewed at large. For ſome ſins no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was allowed; Sacrifices were not pleaſing to God of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; The Expiation did not depend upon the value of the oblation; He that brought an Expiatory ſacrifice was not allowed to eat any part of it; The repetition of the Sacrifices another Argument of their weakneſs; In ſome caſes the Sacrifice was but one of thoſe things required in order to pardon; The Legal Sacrifices were not deſigned to continue for ever. That the defects of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> are ſupplied in the Chriſtian Religion: Of the excellent Precepts of the Chriſtian Religion; Of the promiſe of Eternal life therein clearly revealed, and of the great moment of it; Of the Divine aſſiſtance attending this Religion; Of the aſſurance of pardon from the Chriſtian Religion, and the ſure foundation which it lays for the quieting the Conſciences of Men. The uſefulneſs of the foregoing diſcourſe: A more particular inquiry into the great Ends or Cauſes for which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was given. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:65506:215"/>
               <p>THAT <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his followers taught, came from Heaven, hath been in great meaſure demonſtrated already; For the farther proof of this truth I ſhall conſider the Religion it ſelf which <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his followers taught, and prove that it is a more excellent and perfect Religion than that which was delivered to the <hi>Jews</hi> by the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and conſequently imcomparably the beſt Religion in the World.</p>
               <p>I ſay the beſt in the World: for ſo it muſt be if it once appear that it is more perfect than that which was taught the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes.</hi> For though the Religion of <hi>Moſes</hi> were defective when compared with that of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> yet it was <hi>true</hi> however and came from God.</p>
               <p>But for the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion, how an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſoever it were, it was <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>impious,</hi> not revealed by <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> of him, <hi>inconſtant</hi> and <hi>various, trifling</hi> and <hi>ſilly.</hi> It carried men away from God to the Creature. It taught men to worſhip not onely the Hoſt of Heaven but ſtocks and ſtones and dumb Idols; the very Creatures which they
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65506:215"/>did eat, the Evils which they feared, the very Devils themſelves whom they did not love. It preſcribed impure Rites and Ceremonies, put men upon cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their own fleſh, and to their Children. It was ſo groſs and ſo ſilly that the wiſer ſort of Heathens, though they complied with the uſages of the Vulgar, yet they derided thoſe foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and were therefore eſteemed Atheiſts by the common People.</p>
               <p>It muſt be granted that among the Heathens there were a number of men who had a better ſenſe of things, and have taught many good leſſons of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality: But theſe men diſcourſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly and at rovers for want of a revelation; And when they ſaid any thing of a future ſtate they were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and doubtfull. And the <hi>Stoicks</hi> themſelves, who were a moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sect among the wiſeſt of their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, did trifle at a great rate, and allowed of ſome things manifeſtly Evil, as well as notoriouſly falſe. I will not here take the pains to examine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of their principles, and to ſhew how differently they acted from what they taught:<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> de repugn. Stoico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> That is done by <hi>Plutarch.</hi> I cannot but take notice that
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65506:216"/>they maintained ſome principles that were immoral and impious, and ſuch as could not come from God.<note place="margin">Arrian. Epicter. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 24. Marc. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonin. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 21. Seneca <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 69.</note> They gave men liberty to murther themſelves, and to goe out of this World without the leave of him who ſent them into it: And this evil and impious Doctrine was the common and received and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Principle of the Sect, <hi>exerce te ut mortem excipias, &amp;, ſi ita res ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debit, accerſas. Intereſt nihil an illa ad nos veniat an ad illam nos;</hi> ſays <hi>Seneca.</hi> It is true that <hi>Seneca</hi> elſewhere explains himſelf,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 58.</note> and ſeems to allow this liberty onely in an uſeleſs old age, or in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſity: But as that liberty is upon no account to be allowed, ſo it is manifeſt that he ſpeaks inconſiſtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with himſelf: for elſewhere he does not onely allow a wiſe man to kill himſelf,<note place="margin">Seneca <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 70.</note> 
                  <hi>Si multa occurrunt moleſta, &amp; tranquillitatem turbantia.</hi> i. e. <hi>If many troubles ariſe which diſturb him;</hi> But alſo when he ſuſpects that troubles will come upon him. For he goes on thus, <hi>nec hoc tantum in neceſſitate ultima facit, ſed cum primum illi caeperit ſuſpecta eſſe fortuna, diligenter circumſpicit, numquid illo die deſinendum eſt. Nihil exiſtimat ſua referre faciat finem an accipiat.</hi> So
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65506:216"/>that upon the whole matter a man might lawfully kill himſelf when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he thought it convenient. This is a moſt wretched and deteſtable Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a manifeſt invaſion of God's pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and practiſing upon his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Beſides that it is a mean thing to allow a liberty of doeing ſo great an <hi>Evil</hi> to rid our ſelves of ſome preſent trouble, or ſome thing which we fear. For by the ſame reaſon a man may be allowed to kill another man who ſtands in his way, and obſtructs his eaſe and quiet. And indeed by the ſame reaſon he may doe evil that good may come of it, and chuſe to <hi>offend</hi> rather than <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</hi> Thus vain were thoſe men who were deſtitute of a Divine revelation, and followed their own fooliſh imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; who under the profeſſion of a great degree of wiſedom allowed of the greateſt immorality. From the books of <hi>Moſes</hi> the unlawfulneſs of ſelf-murther ſufficiently appears. When God commands not to kill he forbids ſelf-murther as well as killing another man. For if bearing falſe witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelves be a ſin againſt the ninth Commandment which forbids our doeing it againſt our Neighbour,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65506:217"/>the killing our ſelves muſt needs be a ſin againſt the ſixth,<note place="margin">

                  </note> as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> argues well. And when after the floud the ſhedding of man's bloud is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.) it is forbidden for a reaſon which reaches to ſelf-murther as well as the killing of another; <hi>For</hi> in the image of God made he man. <hi>Nam ſi homicida nefarius eſt,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Another principle full of impiety the <hi>Stoicks</hi> maintained and it was this, that a man's happineſs was from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that he need not ſeek it of God, or be beholden to him for it. So that upon the matter they taught men to live without dependance upon God. <hi>

                  <hi>quod beatae vitae cauſa, &amp; firmamentum eſt, ſibi fidere.</hi> i. e. <hi>There is one good thing which is the cauſe and baſis of an happy life, and that is that a man truſt to himſelf.</hi> And afterwards he puts men not upon prayers to God, but upon making themſelves happy; and derides thoſe who expect their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs from above, and ſeek it by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Thus vain and haughty were theſe men who pretended to wiſedom: Whereas in truth nothing ſpeaks truer

               <p>Their condemning all paſſions was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a fooliſh and an evil principle,<note place="margin">Seneca <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 116.</note> and very deſtructive of the great ends of life. They deſtroyed the <hi>man</hi> in order to make him <hi>wiſe.</hi> And pretended that to be a fruit of wiſedom which is the greateſt folly, and the way to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which is indeed the moſt certain obſtruction to it: For we can do as well without legs, as without our paſſions: 'Tis by them we purſue what is good, and flye from evil. They are the <hi>wings</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and without them we are unactive creatures. 'Tis great wiſedom to govern them, to deſire to be rid of them is folly, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of the wiſedom of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. They are the object of vertue, and Miniſter to it. They are good <hi>Servants,</hi> and whiles they are retained as ſuch are of great uſe to us, they are indeed bad <hi>Maſters.</hi> We may not pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the miſerable, <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>This may ſeem too great a digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:65506:218"/>And indeed it is not what I mainly deſigned to ſpeak to. I did not intend to compare our Religion with that of Heathens: It is not worth our while to doe it; By what I have ſaid of the beſt of the Heathens we may ſee how vain and fooliſh their principles were. I ſhall compare the Religion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> with that which God himſelf delivered to the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And ſhall ſhew the defects of the one, and the ſupplies which are made in the other.</p>
               <p>It muſt be granted that the law which was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> came from Heaven; and that it was a very great bleſſing to the <hi>Jews</hi> to whom it was given. It was one of thoſe Crowns (which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſters mention) with which they were adorned; It made their condition much better than that of their neighbours. The words of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> imply no leſs. <hi>What nation is there ſo great, that hath Statutes and Judgments ſo righteous as all this law which I ſet before you this day?</hi> The giving a law to the <hi>Jews</hi> was a ſpecial dignation and favour. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Ja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ob, his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and his Judgments unto Iſrael: He hath not dealt ſo with any nation, and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65506:218"/>as for his Judgments they have not known them.</hi> This was a great treaſure which the <hi>Jews</hi> had, when the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries were not admitted to the favour of a Divine Revelation. The ſtudy of this law is frequently preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them: And the devout <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> does upon all occaſions expreſs the great eſteem which he had for it. It was <hi>ſweeter</hi> to him than <hi>honey,</hi> more <hi>valuable</hi> than <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver;</hi> 'twas the <hi>joy</hi> of his <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>deſire</hi> of his <hi>ſoul,</hi> the <hi>delight</hi> of his <hi>eyes,</hi> and great <hi>comfort</hi> of his <hi>life. Jeſus</hi> himſelf ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all due regard to the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> He profeſſed that he did not come to deſtroy the law and the Prophets, he puts the people upon ſearching the Scriptures; he was circumciſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law; he wore ſuch a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> preſcribed; he obſerved the <hi>Feaſts</hi> which that law appointed; and when he had healed the Leper he ſends him to the Prieſt to doe according to the law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> had no cauſe to quarrel with our Lord in this matter. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet allows that the giving of the law to the <hi>Jews</hi> was a ſingular privilege and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:65506:219"/>He reckons it their great advantage that unto them were <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God,</hi> and that to them pertained the <hi>covenants and the giving of the law.</hi> [Deut. 4.8. Pſ. 147.19, 20. Pſ. 19.10. Pſ. 40.8. Pſ. 119.70, 72, 92, 97, 136. Mat. 5.17 Joh. 5.39. Luk. 2.21. Mat. 10.20. Luk. 2.41. Joh. 2.13, 23. and ch. 7.2. Mat. 8.4. Rom. 3.1, 2. Rom. 9.4.]</p>
               <p>And as the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> came from <hi>God</hi> ſo it muſt alſo be granted that it was (as it is called by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) a <hi>perfect law.</hi> That is, it was well fitted for that <hi>people</hi> to <hi>whom,</hi> and for that <hi>time in</hi> which, and for thoſe <hi>ends, for</hi> which it was given. It taught them their duty to <hi>God,</hi> their <hi>neighbour,</hi> and <hi>themſelves;</hi> and laid before them ſuch precepts as concerned them as <hi>men,</hi> as <hi>members</hi> of a Body <hi>Politick,</hi> and of a <hi>Church.</hi> It was ſo full and ſo complete that it wanted nothing for the end it was deſigned to. It was expreſsly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they to whom it was given ſhould neither add to it nor diminiſh from it. <hi>Ye ſhall not add unto the word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it, that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:65506:219"/>which I commanded you.</hi> It was indeed full of rites and ceremonies, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired nothing immoral, and did not allow of the leaſt ſhadow of Idolatry: Its precepts were <hi>juſt,</hi> they were <hi>conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> they were <hi>plainly</hi> revealed, and ſufficiently confirmed. Indeed many rites and ceremonies were preſcribed: But as they were of God's own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo they were ordained for wiſe ends alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> to keep the people from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to which they were prone, and from the foppiſh and ſuperſtitious uſages of their neighbours; for a proof of their obedience to God, and for the fore-ſhadowing of ſome better things to come: they were many of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtructive, and were ſo many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments or Symbols of very weighty things, [<hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2.]</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid it does not follow that the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was never to be altered: The <hi>Jews</hi> might not add or diminiſh, but God himſelf was not bound by that law. It ſtood upon divine authority and was revealed by <hi>God,</hi> but it does not thence follow that the ſame authority which ſet it up could not take it away; God no where tells us that 'tis his laſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65506:220"/>and that he intended it ſhould be taken as ſuch. God is not obliged to reveal his mind all at once. He may make what laws he pleaſeth, and add to them when he will. Nay God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf does expreſsly declare that he would make <hi>a new Covenant;</hi> And it is added, <hi>not according to the covenant that I made with their Fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> (Jer. 31.31, 32.) It reflects no diſhonour upon God to ſay that he reverſes ſome Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own, that he alters or adds to his own laws. All the laws which proceed from him are not of the ſame importance and moment: The <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves will own this, and the thing is very evident and plain. This appears from the greater or leſs puniſhments aſſigned to the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of theſe laws. There were ſome ſins ſo great as admitted no Sacrifice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate them. There were others which were eaſily atoned for. We do not call the wiſedom of God in queſtion, nor diſparage his law when we ſhew how far ſhort it comes of the Goſpel. For all this while we do but compare one Divine Revelation with another. God
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:65506:220"/>made the Heaven and the earth, and all that which he made was good: It is no reflexion upon his wiſedom or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or veracity to ſay that God will make a new Heaven and a new earth. For God who promiſed to make a <hi>new covenant,</hi> promiſed to make a <hi>new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> alſo. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.22.)</p>
               <p>Theſe things I thought fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that I might proceed in this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty argument with the greater caution: I ſhall now conſider the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> more particularly in order to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this, that the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> does excell it.</p>
               <p>The whole body of the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> comprizeth thoſe precepts given by him, which were either <hi>Moral, Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical,</hi> or <hi>civil:</hi> The <hi>Moral</hi> law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them as <hi>men,</hi> and was given at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in ten diſtinct precepts or Commandments.

               <p>For <hi>ſtatutes</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writers tell us that they are to be underſtood of thoſe precepts the reaſon whereof is not revealed,<note place="margin">Bechai <hi>in Legem. fol.</hi> 185.

[<hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7, 8. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31. and with <hi>v.</hi> 22.]</p>
               <p n="1">1. In its <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> as it was a rule of life. Theſe Precepts are not ſuch as perfect humane nature, and as make men better who obey them. and obedience to them was neceſſary becauſe it was commanded. But they were not ſuch things as tend immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to make men better in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and inclinations. They were good becauſe they were commanded, they were not therefore commanded becauſe they were antecedently good. We doubt not but that God commanded them for wiſe ends during the Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Church, but as they were not to endure for ever (of which I may have occaſion elſewhere to ſpeak more
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:65506:222"/>largely) ſo are they far from being of equal moment and value with the Laws of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> were given to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coſri <hi>par.</hi> 1.</note> and not intended to oblige mankind. The <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſs this. And ſeveral of them were of that nature that they could not be ſuppoſed to concern any of the reſt of mankind. Such were all thoſe Laws which were founded upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which had happened to that People, and of which the obſervances required were but <hi>Memorials</hi> or <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:</hi> Thus the <hi>Paſſover</hi> being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in remembrance of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was a peculiar Law to that People who were delivered thence. The other Nations were not under the ſame obligation, nor do we find that the <hi>Jews</hi> went about to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Law upon the Neigh bouring Countries. The world had continued conſiderably above two thouſand Years before the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and there were in the World very conſiderable examples of Piety in that time; when the Law was given it was given to the <hi>Jews</hi> indeed, but they admitted of <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to live among them who did
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:65506:223"/>not undertake an obedience to the Laws of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The things themſelves which <hi>Moſes</hi> requires are not things in which all men are concerned: Indeed generally ſpeaking they are of that nature, that they cannot belong to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but to them onely to whom they were revealed. All men are bound to be juſt, and to ſpeak the truth, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God and to be chaſt and the like: But for wearing fringes on Garments, or frontlets between the Eyes, for ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or forbearing ſuch or ſuch meats and drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no man could be obliged to theſe Laws but thoſe perſons who had received them from Heaven. For the <hi>Jews</hi> do confeſs that the reaſon of their Laws is not always to be found out, and conſequently the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot be ſuppoſed to oblige mankind. For though the Will of God be reaſon enough for our obedience, yet it is ſo onely to them to whom it is made known. And therefore thoſe Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> which were not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in any other reaſon than the Will of God, could never be deſigned to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all the World.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> de Leg. l. <hi>2.</hi>

                  <hi>Cicero</hi> affirms it to be the opinion of the wiſeſt men, that a Law is ſomething eternal, wiſely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:65506:223"/>the whole World by its affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative and negative Precepts, and that the prime and ultimate Law, <hi>Mentem eſſe omnia ratione aut cogentis aut vetan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Dei.</hi> i. e. <hi>is the Divine mind gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all things with reaſon.</hi> We do not queſtion the wiſedom of God who by <hi>Moſes</hi> gave Laws to the <hi>Jews,</hi> we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay that they were not intended for the whole world, which would have been concerned in them if they had been agreeable to the needs, and the beſt improved reaſon of all mankind, and had been written in the heart of all men.</p>
               <p>And as theſe Laws were onely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo many of theſe Laws did not oblige them in any place beſides their onw <hi>Land</hi> to which they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, which they would have done if they had been Laws <hi>good</hi> antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and ſuch as had been founded upon the eternal reaſon of things. The <hi>Jews</hi> do allow that ſo it was, and do frequently in their Writings diſtinguiſh between thoſe Laws which obliged them <hi>within</hi> the <hi>Land,</hi> and thoſe which obliged them <hi>without</hi> the Land of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> And a very great number of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts they are which were annexed to that very Land in which they lived,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:65506:224"/>and to which they were not obliged any longer, than they kept the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Land. So that what was their duty while they lived together in <hi>Canaan</hi> ceaſed ſo to be when they were <hi>diſpoſſeſſed</hi> of it, and were ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in other Countries. I ſhall not goe about to number up the Precepts which were annexed to that Land: I ſhould too much enlarge if I ſhould give in the full number of thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: I ſhall however name ſome of them. The <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge that the <hi>ſheaf</hi> that was firſt reaped muſt be of the <hi>gowth</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo muſt alſo the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> be which are elſewhere mentioned in their Law, and the Loaves of <hi>Shew-bread</hi> muſt be made of the Corn of that Countrey. The Laws which concerned <hi>Tithes,</hi> the <hi>Sabbatical</hi> year, their year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> their <hi>Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> rites, their Cities of <hi>Refuge,</hi> their <hi>Expiation</hi> of an <hi>uncertain Murther,</hi> and very many others did onely oblige them in their own Land.</p>
               <p>And there were many other Laws which were reſtrained to the <hi>place</hi> which God ſhould chuſe, and to the <hi>Sanctuary;</hi> and thoſe Precepts were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to that very place. If the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:65506:224"/>ſame thing were done elſewhere it was an abomination. The difference of place made a great difference in the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That would paſs for an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> in one place, which in another would be an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Rebellion.</hi> The very many laws concerning <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and the rites of offering them up did all belong to the <hi>Sanctuary:</hi> the precepts concerning the <hi>ſhew-bread,</hi> the offering <hi>incenſe,</hi> the dreſſing the <hi>Candles,</hi> the <hi>Veſtments</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Sota</hi> or Woman ſuſpected of adultery, and very many others were peculiarly annexed to the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary or Temple: And when that was deſtroyed, and out of the <hi>Jews</hi> poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they were diſcharged from all thoſe precepts. And then for the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after God had made choice of that place, there were a very great number of the precepts of <hi>Moſes</hi> which were to be performed there and obliged them no where elſe. Thither they were to go <hi>three</hi> times a year to appear before God, and to worſhip him at their ſolemn times appointed: They might not keep their feſtivals in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>place:</hi> There they muſt eat their <hi>peace-offerings,</hi> their <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> and (the greater part at leaſt of) their <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:65506:225"/>tithes,</hi> and there they muſt keep their <hi>paſſover,</hi> (Deut. 16.2.) ſo that upon the whole matter theſe laws (and they are not a few in number) cannot be kept any longer than they kept in the poſſeſſion of their land. And God by his providence hath rendred theſe precepts unpracticable. Beſides, as the laws about Sacrifices were annexed to a certain place, ſo the offering them up belonged onely to one family, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sons of <hi>Aaron:</hi> No man elſe might ſprinkle the bloud, nor might any of that family do it who had a <hi>blemiſh</hi> which rendered him uncapable; and it might be that he would be rendered ſo by ſome <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>not culpable</hi> infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. So that a great part of the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> are not now able to <hi>practiſe.</hi>

               <p>Of ſuch a ſort were many, I may ſay
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:65506:226"/>moſt, of the laws of <hi>Moſes:</hi> They were very <hi>minute</hi> things which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and the obſervation of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things was very <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>uneaſie</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as very <hi>coſtly,</hi> when they were in their own <hi>land,</hi> but now are <hi>impoſſible</hi> to be obſerved. They were never <hi>eaſie</hi> under the <hi>yoke,</hi> but now by the providence of God they are releaſed from bearing it. It is true there was no <hi>evil thing required</hi> by their law, but yet for their hardneſs of heart and <hi>ſtubbornneſs</hi> ſomethings were <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>permitted,</hi> which were at leaſt <hi>imperfections</hi> and <hi>defects:</hi> Such were <hi>Polygamie,</hi> and <hi>divorces,</hi> and the <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>exacting</hi> a ſtrict <hi>reparation</hi> for all the <hi>wrong</hi> or <hi>damage</hi> which was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I conſider the <hi>reward</hi> which was added to the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the obedience of the <hi>Jews.</hi> It will appear that the <hi>reward</hi> was proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the <hi>precepts:</hi> They were <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi> and <hi>topical,</hi> they were <hi>minute</hi> and <hi>imperfect;</hi> and the <hi>reward</hi> annexed was of the <hi>ſame nature</hi> and <hi>kind,</hi> that was <hi>temporal,</hi> and of this <hi>lower world.</hi> Such as <hi>long life, victory</hi> over <hi>enemies, plenty,</hi> and <hi>proſperity:</hi> Things very
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:65506:226"/>fit to work upon carnal minds, and to invite a people of a worldly temper to obey thoſe precepts which <hi>Moſes</hi> laid before the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no expreſs promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life to be found in the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> This is no where inſerted into the <hi>pact</hi> or <hi>covenant</hi> which God made with that people. I grant that holy men under the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (and before that law was given alſo) had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a future ſtate of bliſs. But this was not expreſsly promiſed in that law, nor as a reward of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it. There were a ſect of the <hi>Jews,</hi> called the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> who allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was from Heaven, and yet denied a future State: This they would ſcarcely have done had eternal life been expreſsly promiſed in that law. I do not queſtion but that the hope of eternal life was to be found among the more pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Jews:</hi> I grant that it was inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under temporal promiſes, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially under that of a <hi>land flowing with milk and honey:</hi> But then <hi>the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canaan lay ſo fair and open to their proſpect</hi> (as an excellent Perſon expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it well) <hi>as eaſily intercepted the view
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65506:227"/>of the Heavenly; and their faith muſt remove, at leaſt overlook, that mountain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could come to any ſight of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and extended Sky.</hi> If any of the <hi>Jews</hi> had any ſight of Heaven it was ſuch a ſight as <hi>Moſes</hi> had of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> he ſaw it at a diſtance from the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> but did not ſee it as <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun</hi> ſaw it, who went over <hi>Jordan</hi> and took poſſeſſion of it, according to the expreſs promiſe he had before received to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now then it cannot be ſuppoſed that there ſhould be many men of eminent vertue under that Religion, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts whereof were <hi>temporary,</hi> and the promiſes but <hi>temporal.</hi> And thoſe that were arrived to an high pitch of Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity under that diſpenſation, attained to that degree from an higher principle than the Letter of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> would have raiſed them to. It muſt be granted that the hope of riches and plenty hath a mighty force and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon men; but it is onely upon <hi>carnal worldlings</hi> that it hath this influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and the love of this world is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo far from advancing piety that it obſtructs it and is the root of all evil. The <hi>Jew</hi> obeyed the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:65506:227"/>for the ſake of worldly proſperity, and when he had obtained it that would be a temptation and ſnare to him: The very reward of obedience was a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to rebell. And though plenty and proſperity be promiſed often in the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as a <hi>reward,</hi> yet it is often mentioned as a <hi>ſnare</hi> too: The <hi>Jews</hi> are often <hi>cautioned</hi> againſt Sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God when they are bleſſed with worldly proſperity. Such promiſes might have ſome influence in inclining men to obey the <hi>letter</hi> of the law, they did not move men <hi>powerfully</hi> to obey the inward and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another great defect in the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was that it did not furniſh the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom it was given, with <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> to obey. It did rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly command obedience, but did not help men to obey. They had not that power aſſured to them from God's promiſe, by which they might be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to obey the <hi>Moral</hi> precepts which they had received. The plentifull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Holy Ghoſt was a bleſſing reſerved for the times of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or the latter days, and is therefore promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as a future bleſſing by the Prophets
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:65506:228"/>themſelves. The law was written which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave, it was not kept from the <hi>Jews;</hi> but the writing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Hearts was promiſed as a part of the <hi>new covenant</hi> which God would make with them. The Letter of the Law was that which the <hi>Jews</hi> regarded, they did not give obedience to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpiritual meaning of it. The law of <hi>Moſes</hi> made nothing perfect, it did not <hi>reform</hi> as well as <hi>teach:</hi> They who were exerciſed in the precepts of <hi>Moſes</hi> were not <hi>renewed</hi> by them: The law was weak and ineffectual and that which did not give life, and power to obey. Hence it is that it is called <hi>fleſh</hi> in the New Teſtament to intimate the weakneſs of that law. It was a ſhadow of good things to come, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was not attended with the <hi>power</hi> which accompanyed thoſe better things when they were exhibited, [<hi>v. Iſa.</hi> 35.7. with ch. 44.3. <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.28. with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.11, 18, 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. ch. 8.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1.]</p>
               <p n="4">4. The law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was defective, compared with the Goſpel, in that it gave not the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of pardon, nor
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:65506:228"/>laid that <hi>foundation</hi> for the <hi>eaſing</hi> and <hi>quieting</hi> the <hi>conſciences</hi> of men which the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is attended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. The law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>a yoke</hi> which the <hi>Jews were never able to bear.</hi> They were ſubjected to the curſe of that law <hi>who confirmed not all the words of it to doe them.</hi> It conſiſted of very many precepts, and they were very <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>operoſe,</hi> ſuch as required great <hi>attention</hi> and <hi>heed, coſt</hi> and great <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> very uneaſie to be <hi>obſerved,</hi> and yet the neglect of any of them expoſed the neglecters to the curſe of that law. Hence it is that the law is called by the Apoſtle the <hi>miniſtration of death</hi> and of <hi>condemnation.</hi> And that State in which the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is repreſented not onely as a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>minority,</hi> but as a State of bondage and <hi>Slavery</hi> alſo, [<hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. with. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.3, 24.]</p>
               <p>And indeed it muſt needs be ſuch a condition that the <hi>Jews</hi> were under; and it will be evident that ſuch it was, when it is conſidered that they were greatly ſtraitned between the great <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty</hi> in <hi>keeping,</hi> and the great danger of <hi>breaking</hi> thoſe laws. They muſt be
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:65506:229"/>uneaſie in their own minds who are perpetually in danger of offending and of being puniſhed. There was no way left for them for perfect eaſe and quiet to their conſcience if the law were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a <hi>covenant</hi> of works. There was not that proviſion made then for peace of mind which was made afterwards in the time of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> It is true there were Sacrifices allowed and preſcribed in that law for the atonement &amp; expiation of the offender: but there are many things to be conſidered which do ſpeak the defectiveneſs of Sacrifices under the law, and ſhewing the need of ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proviſion: And to that purpoſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the following particulars may be duly conſidered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that for ſome ſins there was no <hi>expiatory Sacrifice</hi> allowed in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and conſequently the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was left without <hi>hope of pardon</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the proviſion made under the law by Sacrifices for the obtaining of it. In many caſes the Sinner was to <hi>bear</hi> his <hi>own iniquity,</hi> and could hope for no pardon from any Sacrifice what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And there are very many <hi>ſins</hi> of this ſort: Such were wilfull <hi>murther,</hi> and <hi>blaſphemy</hi> and many other ſins of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:65506:229"/>which we may ſee <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all thoſe ſins which were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>an high hand</hi> were of this ſort: And whatever hope there might be for the ſinner who was ſurprized, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ignorantly, yet if he did it <hi>preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly,</hi> and were guilty of thoſe ſins which admitted no atonement, he was left without hope from the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and was to dye the death. And if the Supreme Magiſtrate did not condemn him, God declared that he would <hi>ſet his face</hi> againſt him and <hi>cut him off.</hi> But of this I have before diſcourſed:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 27.28.</note> [<hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.16. <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.17. <hi>and v.</hi> 13. <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.31, 32. <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.5.]</p>
               <p>Secondly, that where Sacrifices were not onely <hi>allowed</hi> but <hi>preſcribed</hi> by God himſelf yet they were not things of their <hi>own nature</hi> pleaſing unto God: And God did to the <hi>Jews</hi> frequently declare this, and did it after ſuch a manner as might well beat them off from <hi>relying</hi> upon the Sacrifices which they brought to procure their pardon and atonement. I might heap up Scriptures to this purpoſe: I ſhall content my ſelf with theſe that follow. <hi>I will not reprove thee for thy Sacrifices, or thy burnt-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to have been continually before
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:65506:230"/>me: I will take no Bullock out of thine houſe, nor He-goats out of thy folds.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>I deſired mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi> And, <hi>I ſpake not unto your Fathers nor commanded them, in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning burnt-offerings or Sacrifices: But this thing commanded I them ſaying, obey my voice,</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sacrifices unto me? ſaith the Lord: I am full of the burnt-offerings of Rams, and the fat of fed Beaſts: And I delight not in the bloud of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of He-goats: bring no more vain oblations,</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>He that killeth an Oxe is as if he ſlew a man: He that ſacrificeth a Lamb as if he out off a Dogs neck: He that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth an oblation as if he offered Swines bloud: He that burneth incenſe as if he bleſſed an Idol,</hi> [Pſ. 50.8, 9. Hoſ. 6.6. Jer. 7.22, 23. Iſai. 1.11, 13. ch. 66.3.]</p>
               <p>God did indeed not onely allow but in certain caſes command Sacrifices. But God required obedience to his covenant antecedently to Sacrifices. This was his firſt intention, and not Sacrifice, for that he required onely <hi>conſequently,</hi> and as a remedy when the ſin was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Sacrifice, like repentance, was
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:65506:230"/>but <hi>tabula poſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aufragium:</hi> It was the way of reconciling Sinners when they had offended. Sacrifices were enjoyned after the law which was the rule of life was given: And not onely the moral law was given before Sacrifices were commanded, but the <hi>political</hi> law was delivered before the particular laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the kinds and rites of Sacrifices were given out. God would have them obey, and rather <hi>not need</hi> then <hi>bring</hi> a Sacrifice. For a Sacrifice was but a Subſtitute upon the failure of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it was the Sinners refuge. <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? behold to obey is better than Sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of Rams</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth us to be more ready to <hi>hear</hi> (i. e. to <hi>obey,</hi> than to <hi>give the Sacrifice of fools.</hi> [1 Sam. 15.22. Eccl. 5.1.]</p>
               <p>And this is no more than what the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves are forced to confeſs.<note place="margin">More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vohim. <hi>p.</hi> 111. <hi>c.</hi> 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Maimon</hi> does confeſs that God put a great difference between that part of his worſhip which conſiſted in oblations, and that which <hi>conſiſted</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Supplication:</hi> That <hi>Oblations</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> were but the <hi>ſecond intention</hi> of
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:65506:231"/>God; and that <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> were agreeable to his <hi>firſt.</hi> He adds to my preſent purpoſe. <q>That though oblations and Sacrifices were offered up to the honour of God yet the <hi>Jews</hi> had not the liberty in that matter which the Ancients enjoyed. For the <hi>Jews</hi> might not offer them up in any place or at any time. They might not build a Temple where they pleaſed, nor offer what they liſt, nor by the hands of any men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, but they were determined to a certain place, and to certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were the Family of Prieſts; which are diminutions of that kind of Divine worſhip: Whereas Prayer and Supplication were allowed in every place and to every perſon.</q> Now this is an argument that Sacrifices were not of their own nature things acceptable and pleaſing to God;<note place="margin">

               <p>God did not accept an expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:65506:231"/>for the ſake of the oblation: It was then onely welcome when it was a Teſtimony of the repentance and the devotion of the offerer. There was no Sacrifice that was in its own nature good; and ſeparately conſidered accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God. If the Sacrifice were <hi>piacular</hi> then it was the <hi>contrition</hi> of the offerer which gave it a <hi>ſweet ſavour:</hi> If it were <hi>Euchariſtical</hi> it was accepted one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it was a <hi>pledge</hi> or <hi>token</hi> of the <hi>gratefull reſentment</hi> of God's <hi>mercies</hi> in him that brought it, or an <hi>argument</hi> of <hi>homage</hi> in him who preſented it.

                  <hi>and his Sacrifices are prophane; his vows are infamous, and very deſtructive: Theſe do not deſtroy ſin, but rather bring it to remembrance.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that where Sacrifices were offered by God's command, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his direction in all reſpects, and where an expiation or atonement was effected and obtained, yet in that caſe the <hi>expiation</hi> did not proceed from the <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>value</hi> of the oblation. And things were ſo ordained that the <hi>Jews</hi> might be ſenſible that the Sacrifices did not of their own <hi>force</hi> or upon the ſcore of their own <hi>value</hi> procure the offerers pardon. And to that purpoſe I ſhall annex an obſervation of <hi>Maimon:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voch. <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 46. Abravenel <hi>in Legem. fol.</hi> 251. <hi>col.</hi> 3.</note> He tells that, <hi>by how mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:65506:232"/>Nor is this the ſingle opinion of <hi>Maimon</hi> onely, <hi>Abravenel</hi> aſſents unto it. If this be ſo, there cannot be a more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof than this for the purpoſe for which I make uſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that the Sacrifices did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the offerers pardon upon the ſcore of their intrinſick value. For if they had, the <hi>greater</hi> offences would have required the <hi>moſt coſtly</hi> Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>It is alſo otherwiſe very evident that the Sacrifices and Purifications under the law did not reconcile the offerer and the unclean upon the ſcore of their own vertue, and intrinſick worth; no more than the brazen Serpent cured the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> by its own inherent vertue: The <hi>Scape-goat</hi> that did <hi>bear upon him all the iniquities</hi> of the Congregation, did not remove the ſins of the people by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inherent vertue or Sanctity: Nay it was ſo far from it, that the man who let him go was defiled by him, and might not till he had <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The water of Purification was of a very extenſive uſe for the purifying thoſe who were legally unclean; the aſhes of a red Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer was of principal moment as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:65506:233"/>in that water: but thoſe aſhes did not purifie from any vertue of their own: The Prieſt who miniſtred in that preparation was obliged to bathe his Fleſh and waſh his Clothes, and ſo was he who burnt the Heifer: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a man that was legally <hi>clean</hi> was to gather up thoſe aſhes, which were the principal ingredient in the water of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, yet that very man, who was clean before he gathered the aſhes, was, by gathering of them, rendred unclean, and likewiſe obliged to waſh his Clothes. (<hi>Numb.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9, 10.) However theſe aſhes ſerved to purifie the people who were unclean, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that they did it not upon the ſcore of their inherent vertue, becauſe they defiled him that was clean before. Well might the Authour of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay, <hi>it is not poſſible that the bloud of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away ſins,</hi> (Heb. 10.4.)

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the offerer who brought an <hi>expiatory</hi> Sacrifice was not allowed to partake of the offering which he brought, and conſequently had the leſs hope from that oblation which he
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:65506:233"/>offered up. It was the Cuſtome of the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as of the ancient Heathens to feaſt upon their Sacrifices: when they did ſo it was a token of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation:<note place="margin">Diſcourſe of the Lord's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <hi>ch. 1.</hi>
                  </note> eating and drinking together was a federal right, and a token of friendſhip, as I have elſewhere ſhewed: And as it was eſteemed ſo among men, ſo it was between God and the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites:</hi> where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to partake of the Sacrifices it was allowed them as a <hi>ſign</hi> of their being <hi>reconciled,</hi> and as a <hi>token of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> and good will to them. But this was never allowed them when they brought piacular or expiatory Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; in that caſe they did never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Altar.

                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:65506:237"/>the offerer did not come to make <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement</hi> for his ſin, a part was offered upon the Altar, a part was allowed to the Prieſt, and a part was alſo allowed to the People who brought the Sacrifice. This was a pledge or token of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, when they were admitted to partake of the Altar. But when the People were not allowed this liberty (as they were never allowed it when they brought expiatory Sacrifices) when the eating of bloud was univerſally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, and the eating the fleſh of piacular. Sacrifices was not allowed to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they could have but ſaint hopes of pardon, and God's favour from theſe Victims which they brought. This denoted the imperfection of thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and that they could not be confided in or relied upon: They were conſumed, when they were offered, there was no part left to nouriſh the offerer, and to give him juſt hope that God was appeaſed and his juſtice ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and that he was received to his favour again. If he had been admitted to partake of the <hi>Altar,</hi> he might have looked on himſelf as <hi>Gods</hi> gueſt and <hi>friend,</hi> one that <hi>eat</hi> of his <hi>meat,</hi> and conſequently in his favour. But it was
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:65506:237"/>quite otherwiſe. The ſinner brought his offering to the Altar, imparted to it his guilt, it died in his room or ſtead, and this is all that he had to doe with it. It did not come back to him from the Altar, no part of the fleſh was left for him as a token that God was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the reſt, he had no nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of what was thus offered: The ſinner imparted death to the beaſt which he ſacrificed; but that did not impart life or nouriſhment to him back again.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, another argument of the weakneſs of thoſe legal Sacrifices, may be drawn from the repetition of them. They are weak remedies which muſt be frequently renewed: It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they had not power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſins, and to rid the offerer for the future from the like miſcarriages. They did neither ſecure the offerer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>power</hi> or againſt the <hi>guilt</hi> of his ſins for the time to come. And this argument is uſed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour or the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and it is a moſt unexceptionable one. <hi>The Law</hi> (ſays he) <hi>can never with thoſe Sacrifices, which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:65506:238"/>perfect. For then would they not have ceaſed to be offered? Becauſe that the worſhippers once purged, ſhould have had no more conſcience of ſins. For in thoſe</hi> Sacrifices there is a <hi>remembrance again</hi> made <hi>of ſins every year.</hi> Heb. 10.1, 2, 3. The return of the Sacrifices, which were conſtantly offered at their ſtated times, was an argument that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe was not cured which they were brought to remove. If the remedy had been powerfull it would at once have removed the cauſe; But as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it was weak it was repeated frequently. Thus it was under the Law of <hi>Moſes; Every Prieſt ſtandeth daily miniſtring and offering oftentimes the ſame Sacrifices which can never take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſins.</hi> Heb. 10.11.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Thoſe Sacrifices under the Law as they were <hi>carnal</hi> themſelves, ſo they were in their effects alſo. Thoſe <hi>gifts and ſacrifices could not make him that did the ſervice perfect as pertaining to the Conſcience.</hi> (Heb. 9.9.) They did not mend the mind of the man, they did not reform his inward tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and inclination: The <hi>Moſaical</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances were but <hi>carnal ordinances,</hi> and the <hi>bloud of Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats;</hi> and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:65506:238"/>the <hi>aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling</hi> the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> they did indeed <hi>ſanctify,</hi> but it was onely to the <hi>purifying of the fleſh.</hi> (v. 10, 13.) Theſe things did remove the <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> Uncleanneſs, but they did not cleanſe the heart of him that was <hi>ſpiritually</hi> defiled. Thoſe obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and purifications did remove ſome <hi>legal pollutions</hi> and <hi>impediments:</hi> As for example; he who was under a legal impurity was excluded from the Camp or City, and from the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his brethren: he might not be admitted to the Mountain of the Lord's Houſe who was under the legal unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>iſſues</hi> or <hi>flux:</hi> He that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by the dead might not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Chel,</hi> or incloſure about the Courts of the Sanctuary: There were other legal uncleanneſſes which debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red men of the liberty of going into the Court of <hi>Women</hi> and that of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> But all theſe reſtraints were taken off by the Sacrifices and Purifications al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and preſcribed in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And this is that ſanctifying to the <hi>purifying of the fleſh,</hi> which the Authour of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> mentions. But alas, theſe things did not purify or quiet the Conſcience of the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:65506:239"/>ſinner. They neither made him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the future, nor did they remove the <hi>horrours</hi> of his Conſcience upon the account of his greater crimes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities.</p>
               <p>He might come into the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who was before excluded, and he might be admitted to the Sanctuary, who by the Law was before denied that liberty, but ſtill the man was the ſame when theſe legal impediments were taken out of the way. He was not renewed in his mind, he was not caſed in his conſcience, nor ſecured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more by this courſe againſt future evils, here or hereafter.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It is evident that where Sacrifice was allowed toward the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining pardon, yet ſometimes the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don was not obtained by the Sacrifice: For the piacular Sacrifice was but one of the conditions upon which the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the offerer did depend: So that ſuppoſing the Sacrifice offered up ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to the Law, yet the ſinner was not thereupon remitted. In caſe of treſpaſs and wrong there was required by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>reſtitution</hi> alſo of the principal, and ſometime the <hi>addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:65506:239"/>of a <hi>fifth</hi> part as well as ſacrifice. (<hi>Numb.</hi> 5.7.) As in ſome caſes no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was admitted, ſo at other times where it was allowed, yet it did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to favour, ſome other things being alſo required neceſſary to his pardon as well as that. The <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves tell us, <hi>that the day of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation did not procure the pardon of thoſe ſins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joma <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>which men committed againſt their brethren, till they had given ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to their brethren whom they had injured.</hi> If they had injured them in words, they were bound to <hi>appeaſe</hi> them, and to be reconciled; if they had done it in their goods, they were bound to make <hi>reſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, It was a very hard thing for the <hi>Jew</hi> to know whether he were pardoned or not: And notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the proviſion made by Sacrifices, yet that proviſion could not eaſe the ſinner's mind. We will ſuppoſe the greateſt care uſed to obtain pardon by an expiatory Sacrifice, yet the offerer would be left uneaſie in his own mind. In ſuch a multitude of precepts, and of that nature alſo, which the <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> were, it was almoſt impoſſible for a man to know whether he had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:65506:240"/>or not, and conſequently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was obliged to bring his ſin or treſpaſs-offering. Hence it was that the <hi>Jews</hi> appointed a treſpaſs-offering, which they call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or, a <hi>doubtfull treſpaſs-offering,</hi> which they thought themſelves obliged to bring when it was a doubtfull caſe, whether they had tranſgreſſed or not.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is very certain that theſe Sacrifices of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> were not to continue for ever. The <hi>Jews</hi> were given to underſtand ſo much, and God taught them this more ways than one. He annexed them to a certain place, and to a certain family who were to offer them up, and when that place was no longer in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they were diſcharged from all their obligation to offer Sacrifices at once. And beſides that many of them were but types and ſhadows of things to come, and were therefore in due time to ceaſe. God did expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretell this to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writers themſelves are forced to confeſs no leſs. Of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſies that he ſhould cauſe the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> and <hi>oblation</hi> to ceaſe (<hi>Dan.</hi> 9.27.) That is, all the <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:65506:240"/>made by fire</hi> whatſoever. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us the ſame of <hi>burnt-offerings</hi> and <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for ſin.</hi> (Heb. 10.6.) That is, Sacrifices which were expiatory. And there is a ſaying to this purpoſe among the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writers,<note place="margin">Midraſh Tillim <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 56.12. <hi>v.</hi> Abrave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>de cap. fidei cum</hi> Vorſtio <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>that every Corban or Sacrifice ſhould ceaſe, but that the Sacrifice of praiſe ſhould never ceaſe.</hi> And this ſaying of the <hi>Jews</hi> relates to the days of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The Sacrifices allowed in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were of very little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their own nature: They were never deſigned to continue longer than the City, the Temple and Altar ſtood, to which they were annexed.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Thus I have given ſome account of the defects of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, as it was delivered to them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as it ſtands compared with the Religion which our <hi>Jeſus</hi> taught. I ſhall now proceed to ſhew,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> That theſe defects are made up and ſupplied by the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that the Chriſtian Religion is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon very far preferible to that of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to the making this evident I ſhall,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, the <hi>Precepts</hi> of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion, and look upon it as a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> and we ſhall find it the moſt accurate rule of life that ever was made known to the World. There is not in any Religion whatſoever any parallel to the Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The Precepts of this Religion are agreeable to the reaſon of mankind, they tend to perfect humane nature, and render it like the Divine: They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves to the Conſciences of all wife and conſidering men, and thoſe very men who do not obey them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but approve of them, and have an inward veneration for them who do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:65506:241"/>As to that duty we owe to God we are taught to perform it becoming his Divine Majeſty, and his adorable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. We are directed to <hi>believe</hi> him, to <hi>fear</hi> him above all, to <hi>love</hi> him with our <hi>whole heart,</hi> to <hi>truſt</hi> in him and <hi>depend</hi> upon him in all our <hi>ſtraits</hi> and <hi>needs,</hi> to <hi>ſubmit</hi> quietly to his <hi>Government,</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> his <hi>will:</hi> To <hi>worſhip</hi> him with <hi>pure hearts,</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> to him with <hi>great fervour</hi> and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; To <hi>give</hi> him hearty <hi>thanks,</hi> and to do what we do for his <hi>Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe duties are founded upon the greateſt reaſon. For if we believe his <hi>veracity</hi> we are obliged to give <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> to his <hi>Revelation</hi> though we be not able to comprehend what he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal. He that is <hi>almighty,</hi> ought to be <hi>feared</hi> above all, and he who is onely <hi>good,</hi> and moſt <hi>beneficial</hi> to us ought be <hi>loved</hi> with our <hi>whole heart.</hi> Upon whom ſhall we <hi>truſt</hi> and <hi>relye</hi> but upon him who is <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to help them that truſt in him? Is it not fit we ſhould <hi>ſubmit</hi> to him who is <hi>infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe,</hi> and who <hi>governs</hi> all things in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>earth?</hi> And whoſe <hi>will</hi> ſhould we <hi>do</hi> but his who is without <hi>iniquity,</hi> who is juſt and right? If he be
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:65506:242"/>a <hi>Spirit</hi> it is fit we ſhould worſhip him in <hi>Spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth.</hi> And ſince we know that he <hi>hears,</hi> it is very reaſonable we ſhould at all times, and with great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour <hi>pray</hi> unto him. And ſince we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> all good things <hi>from</hi> him it is but juſt we ſhould <hi>praiſe</hi> him as the <hi>Authour</hi> of all, and that we ſhould <hi>glorifie</hi> him as the ultimate <hi>end</hi> of all.</p>
               <p>For the duties we owe to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian Religion gives the moſt incomparable rules. It requires a <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſubmiſſion</hi> to our Superiors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours even then when we ſuffer wrong. It teaches us the moſt <hi>exact juſtice</hi> and the greateſt <hi>humanity,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> to one another. It obligeth us to pray for our greateſt enemies and to forgive them who do us the greateſt wrong. It allows us to do no wrong to another and to return none which is done to us. It is ſo far from allowing us to kill thoſe who are of another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that it permits us not to hate them. There is no <hi>friendſhip</hi> ſo invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable and <hi>ſacred,</hi> no <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſo <hi>imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> no <hi>charity</hi> ſo <hi>unfained</hi> and <hi>extended,</hi> and ſo <hi>fervent,</hi> no <hi>gentleneſs</hi> ſo <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary</hi> as that which obtains among the genuine followers of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> They who
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:65506:242"/>are ſuch live at perfect peace with one another; they think no evil ſo far they are from doing it: They love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a pure heart fervently.</p>
               <p>As to our ſelves our holy Religion recommends to us the <hi>profoundeſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> the greateſt <hi>meekneſs</hi> under calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>patience</hi> under ſufferings, <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs</hi> in every condition; it teaches the moſt unbroken <hi>fortitude,</hi> the moſt <hi>unſpotted chaſtity;</hi> the moſt <hi>unſhaken conſtancy;</hi> it teacheth us ſtrict <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in eating and drinking, great <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> in the uſe of bodily exerciſes; painfull <hi>diligence</hi> in our ſeveral callings, a ſingular <hi>modeſty</hi> and <hi>gravity;</hi> it puts us upon the greateſt <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> and <hi>candour,</hi> the greateſt <hi>contempt</hi> of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and the greateſt <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt</hi> after <hi>Spiritual.</hi>

                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:65506:243"/>was. But what was aenigmatically and ſymbolically taught in the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is plainly delivered in the Chriſtian Religion: We are taught to offer up <hi>fervent Prayers</hi> inſtead of <hi>incenſe,</hi> to <hi>pare</hi> away all <hi>ſuperfluity</hi> of <hi>naughtineſs</hi> inſtead of <hi>circumciſing</hi> the <hi>foreskin;</hi> we have our <hi>Sacrifices of praiſe</hi> inſtead of the <hi>bloudy Sacrifices,</hi> and are taught to offer up to God our <hi>ſouls</hi> and <hi>bodies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>Holocauſts</hi> preſcribed in that law: We are required to pay a <hi>reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> ſervice inſtead of that <hi>bodily</hi> one which God required of the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe things which our Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires are good in themſelves, and the practice of them makes us better, and are therefore of general and univerſal good to mankind, and the whole race of mankind is concerned in them.

The <hi>Jews</hi> were tyed to certain ordinances and obſervations which rendred them very different from the Gentile world, and they thought they could not converſe with them by their Religion, and did deſpiſe them greatly: hence it was that there was a great Enmity between the one and the other, and thus things ſtood till <hi>Jeſus</hi> came, and till he ſuffered:<note place="margin">Eph. 2.14, 15.</note> But by cancelling thoſe <hi>diſtinguiſhing Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> which he did by his Croſs, he <hi>aboliſhed the Enmity,</hi> and <hi>made peace:</hi> He did thereby reconcile both to God having <hi>ſlain the Enmity.</hi> [1 Cor. 12.13.

               <p>There were ſome things allowed in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon the account of the hardneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> hearts, and for the time of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which are now by the better Law of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſuperſeded, ſuch were <hi>Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> and <hi>Divorces:</hi> And many other things were required during that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of the Church which we are

               <p>God did thus by the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to obey thoſe ordinances by the promiſe of victory, and plenty and long life: He deſigned all this while greater things, and though he did not clearly promiſe, yet he did intend to beſtow the Bleſſing of Eternal life to his ſincere and faithfull Servants. But the clear promiſe of Eternal life was a
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:65506:245"/>bleſſing which God reſerved for the times of the Goſpel. The good men under the Law <hi>obtained indeed a good report by faith:</hi> And by the great things they did, and ſuffered, they gave proof that their faith was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and accompanied with an hope that extended beyond this preſent ſtate: But ſtill the expreſs promiſe of Eternal life was reſerved for the days of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And this is the clear meaning of the words of the Authour of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>

                  <hi>For the Law made nothing perfect,</hi> i. e. it did not perfect thoſe very men who lived under it, and ſubmitted to it. For it not giving a full pardon for offences, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording expreſs aſſurance of Eternal life, it was not powerfull enough to perfect thoſe who were under it. But then
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:65506:245"/>follows, what the Goſpel doeth. But <hi>the bringing in of a better hope did, by the which we draw nigh unto</hi> God.

               </p>
               <p>Agreeably hereunto it is alſo ſaid of <hi>Jeſus</hi> that he was <hi>made a ſurety of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Teſtament.</hi> (Heb. 7.22.) And a <hi>Mediatour of a better Covenant which was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi> (Heb. 8.6.) And it is elſewhere ſaid of <hi>Jeſus</hi> that he hath <hi>aboliſhed death and brought life, and immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> (2 Tim. 2.10.) And the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe elſewhere.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.6, 7, 8.</note> He tells there were two parts of the Sanctuary, which he calls two Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles; and that <hi>the Prieſts went always</hi> (i. e. conſtantly twice every day) <hi>into the firſt Tabernacle accompliſhing the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</hi> viz. to offer incenſe, and to take care of the Lamps: <hi>But into the ſecond went the high Prieſt alone once every year not without bloud, which he offered for himſelf and the errours of the people.</hi> Thus the High Prieſt, at
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:65506:246"/>the day of expiation onely, was admitted into the Holy of Holies: The meaning of this is expreſſed in the following words. <hi>The holy Ghoſt this ſignifying that the way into the holieſt of all, was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding.</hi> The meaning of which words is plainly this; That the holy Spirit by this appointment, in the <hi>Moſaical</hi> inſtitution,<note place="margin">

               <p>Here we have an encouragement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably great and ſuch as will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently move us to obedience. The hope of eternal life is enough to engage us to obey the precepts of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile

Hence it is that the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.21 Gal. 5.4.

<pb n="456" facs="tcp:65506:248"/>onely aſſurance of pardon upon your ſincere repentance, but are encouraged alſo by the promiſe of eternal life, and offered aſſiſtance to enable you to obey.</p>
               <p>On the other hand the law was weak, and had not this promiſe of the Spirit annexed unto it.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.5. Gal 4.9. Phil. 3.3. <hi>with</hi> Rom. 8.3. Gal. 3.3. Heb. 7.16.</note> And upon the account of its weakneſs it is very frequently called <hi>fleſh</hi> in the new Teſtament, as the Goſpel is called the miniſtration of the <hi>Spirit</hi> upon the account of that power enabling us to obey with which it is attended. And the <hi>legal</hi> ordian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are called <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>beggarly elements,</hi> or, <hi>rudiments.</hi> And indeed the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> might be juſtly called weak as compared with the Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; for the law was not able to effect what the Goſpel hath done; it <hi>gave not life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3.21. Rom. 7.5, 8.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> The <hi>aſſurance</hi> of <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin which the Goſpel gives, and conſequently the foundation it layes for the <hi>quieting</hi> our <hi>conſciences,</hi> far beyond what was done by the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> I have before ſhewed the defectiveneſs of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion by Sacrifices which was made in the law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> I ſhall ſhew that this is ſupplied in the covenant of grace made by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And this was foretold very particularly as a ſpecial and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar grace belonging to this new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as it is diſtinguiſhed from that between God and <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make. God promiſes not onely to <hi>write</hi> the <hi>law upon their hearts,</hi> and
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:65506:249"/>conſequently to work in them the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of himſelf, but more eſpecially aſſures them of their pardon and remiſſion.<note place="margin">Jer. 31.34.</note> 
                  <hi>For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing bears ſo hard upon a man as his guilt does. And in many things we offend all. We are all guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more or leſs, and conſequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the horrors of our conſcience and the wrath of God. This is the great torment of life, and there is no trouble like it. A guilty mind bears harder upon us than any outward <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And then he that hath ſinned is anxious and ſuſpicious, he is not eaſily aſſured of his pardon: he that broke the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was liable to the Curſe of it. And though Sacrifices were allowed, I have ſhewed the defects of that proviſion.</p>
               <p>But the Goſpel gives us the utmoſt aſſurance of our pardon upon terms that are gentle, and reaſonable, and by no means to be refuſed. What-ever our ſins have been, yet upon our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſincere obedience for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are ſure of God's favour, and of his being reconciled to us: He beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:65506:249"/>us now to be reconciled to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe gentle and eaſie terms: This is the Tenor of this new <hi>covenant</hi> or <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> of which <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Mediator:</hi> He hath procured this for us, he hath <hi>purchaſed</hi> this by his <hi>merits, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> it by his own precious <hi>bloud, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> it to us by his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>powerfull interceſſion;</hi> he <hi>confirmed</hi> it by <hi>ſtupendious Miracles, proclaimed</hi> it to all the world by his <hi>meſſengers,</hi> and <hi>given</hi> us the <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>evidences</hi> of it by his <hi>holy Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>ſolemn inſtitutions.</hi> There is nothing wanting to enſure this our pardon unto us: Here's no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow left for our doubt or anxious fears, we have all the poſſible aſſurance which we can deſire.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.8, 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>While we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us: much more then being now juſtified by his bloud we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> Theſe laſt words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an argument invincible, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unanſwerable, and ſuch as affords the ſtrongeſt conſolation: If God look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after us when we were his avowed enemies, if even then he gave up his
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:65506:250"/>moſt dear Son to death, and at ſo great an expence reſtored us to favour, ſurely he will now not abandon us to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He that was ſo kind to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will not now forſake his friends. So great and dear a love will not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. It was a great price (and an inſtance of the greateſt love) by which we were reconciled when we were enemies, 'twas by the death of the Son of God. We had little reaſon to expect this favour and this expence. But now we may be ſaved without his giving up his Son again to death, and need not therefore doubt that we ſhall be ſaved by his life. The <hi>Jew</hi> under the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had great cauſe to fear, for when he tranſgreſſed (and that he did when-ever he continued not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to all the words of that law) he put himſelf under the rigour and curſe of the law. But God hath now made a better covenant with us, and given us the greateſt hopes of pardon upon our repentance and ſincere (though it be not ſin-leſs) obedience to the laws of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is pardon to be had for <hi>all manner</hi> of ſin. There were many ſins under the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as hath been obſerved, for which no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 12.31.</note> We are better provided for by this covenant of grace. <hi>All manner of ſin and blaſphemy</hi> (ſays <hi>Chriſt</hi>) <hi>ſhall be forgiven unto men.</hi> Blaſphemy, as hath been obſerved before, was one of thoſe ſins for which there was no expiation allowed under the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But even for this ſin there is pardon in this covenant of grace.

               <p>It is true indeed that our Saviour hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Matt. 12.32.</note> that <hi>whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt it ſhall not be forgiven him.</hi> And it is the onely ſin which is excepted.

Thus it is ſaid that the <hi>Law</hi> was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that grace and <hi>truth</hi> come by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                     <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith came, we were under the Law, ſhut up unto the faith, which ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be revealed; wherefore the Law was our School-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith.</hi> Whoever duly conſiders what hath been ſaid above of the nature of many
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:65506:259"/>of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> precepts (which were of their own nature things very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute) of their ſymbolicalneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to better things to come, of the malediction to which the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of the Law were ſubject, and the defectiveneſs of the Legal Sacrifices, and the ſlender hope of pardon which that Law afforded, will eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the Law was a School-maſter to bring men to Chriſt. The Law ſhewed men their diſeaſe, but did not cure and heal them, but referred them to ſome better proviſion which our Lord hath made for us in the Goſpel.</item>
